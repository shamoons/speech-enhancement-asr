1069-133699-0000 HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
1069-133699-0001 TO DEAL WITH HER IN STRICT RECIPROCITY HE CARRIED OUT HIS RESOLVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TACT AND THE YOUNG LADY FOUND IN RENEWED CONTACT WITH HIM NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS FOR UNSHRINKING ENQUIRY
1069-133699-0002 THE GENERAL APPLICATION OF HER CONFIDENCE HER SITUATION AT GARDENCOURT THEREFORE APPRECIATED AS WE HAVE SEEN HER TO BE BY ISABEL AND FULL OF APPRECIATION HERSELF OF THAT FREE PLAY OF INTELLIGENCE
1069-133699-0003 SHE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN TRUTH THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS OF THE LIGHTEST AND THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MISS STACKPOLE BEHAVED MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD DEFINED HER TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0004 AS BOTH AN ADVENTURESS AND A BORE ADVENTURESSES USUALLY GIVING ONE MORE OF A THRILL SHE HAD EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT HER NIECE'S HAVING SELECTED SUCH A FRIEND
1069-133699-0005 YET HAD IMMEDIATELY ADDED THAT SHE KNEW ISABEL'S FRIENDS WERE HER OWN AFFAIR AND THAT SHE HAD NEVER UNDERTAKEN TO LIKE THEM ALL OR TO RESTRICT THE GIRL TO THOSE SHE LIKED
1069-133699-0006 MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
1069-133699-0007 I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
1069-133699-0008 I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
1069-133699-0009 AND SHE DETESTS ME FOR DETESTING IT
1069-133699-0010 MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
1069-133699-0011 WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
1069-133699-0012 RALPH WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL GENIALITY SUGGESTED BY WAY OF HEALING THE BREACH THAT THE TRUTH LAY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED AS FAIR MIDDLING
1069-133699-0013 THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
1069-133699-0014 I LIKE TO BE TREATED AS AN AMERICAN LADY POOR AMERICAN LADIES CRIED MISSUS TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH THEY'RE THE SLAVES OF SLAVES THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN HENRIETTA RETORTED
1069-133699-0015 THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR SERVANTS THE IRISH CHAMBERMAID AND THE NEGRO WAITER THEY SHARE THEIR WORK DO YOU CALL THE DOMESTICS IN AN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SLAVES MISS STACKPOLE ENQUIRED
1069-133699-0016 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0017 I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT WITH FIVE HENRIETTA COULDN'T HELP OBSERVING I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE FIVE PERSONS SURROUNDING ME IN THAT MENIAL POSITION
1069-133699-0018 SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
1069-133699-0019 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
1069-133699-0020 WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0021 MY DEAR FRIEND I WONDER IF YOU'RE GROWING FAITHLESS FAITHLESS FAITHLESS TO YOU HENRIETTA NO THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PAIN BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAITHLESS TO MY COUNTRY THEN
1069-133699-0022 THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
1069-133699-0023 YOU DON'T ASK THAT RIGHT AS IF YOU THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'RE THINKING OF OTHER THINGS TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'LL THINK OF THAT WILL YOU REALLY THINK OF IT THAT'S WHAT I WISH TO BE SURE OF
1069-133699-0024 I'VE NOT MUCH CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SAID ISABEL HENRIETTA GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE FOR A PERIOD WHICH TRIED ISABEL'S PATIENCE SO THAT OUR HEROINE ADDED AT LAST
1069-133699-0025 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0026 HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOU BUT I SPOKE OF YOU A GOOD DEAL ISABEL WAITED AT THE MENTION OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S NAME SHE HAD TURNED A LITTLE PALE I'M VERY SORRY YOU DID THAT SHE OBSERVED AT LAST
1069-133699-0027 I COULD HAVE TALKED A LONG TIME TO SUCH A LISTENER HE WAS SO QUIET SO INTENSE HE DRANK IT ALL IN WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME ISABEL ASKED I SAID YOU WERE ON THE WHOLE THE FINEST CREATURE I KNOW
1069-133699-0028 WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
1069-133699-0029 IT'S NOT A GRAND PASSION I'M VERY SURE IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE SURE ISABEL GAVE RATHER A COLD SMILE I SHALL SAY IT BETTER TO MISTER GOODWOOD HIMSELF
1069-133699-0030 ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
1069-133699-0031 BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
1069-133699-0032 BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
1069-133699-0033 ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
1069-133699-0034 BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
1069-133699-0035 IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
1069-133699-0036 AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
1069-133699-0037 AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
1069-133699-0038 WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
1069-133699-0039 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0040 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0041 SHE COMMUNICATED HER DISBELIEF TO HER FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS NEVERTHELESS SHE STOOD PREPARED TO HEAR THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME ANNOUNCED THE FEELING PRESSED UPON HER IT MADE THE AIR SULTRY
1069-133699-0042 AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
1069-133699-0043 SHE FORMED AMONG THE FLICKERING SHADOWS A GRACEFUL AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
1069-133699-0044 AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
1069-133699-0045 BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0047 OF LATE IT WAS NOT TO BE DENIED LITERATURE HAD SEEMED A FADING LIGHT AND EVEN AFTER SHE HAD REMINDED HERSELF THAT HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY WAS PROVIDED WITH A COMPLETE SET OF THOSE AUTHORS WHICH NO GENTLEMAN'S COLLECTION SHOULD BE WITHOUT
1069-133699-0048 SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
1069-133699-0049 YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
1069-133699-0050 I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LET ME BRING YOU OVER TO MY CONVICTION MY REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS HOPE HAD BEEN OF THE BEST BUT YOU DISAPPOINTED IT I FOUND YOU CHANGED
1069-133699-0051 ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
1069-133699-0052 I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
1069-133699-0053 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133699-0054 CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
