1116-132851-0000 AND SHOES WITH SILVER BUCKLES THE WOMEN WERE ALL FILLED WITH ENVY BUT LITTLE CARED BARBAIK WHAT THEY MIGHT WHISPER BEHIND HER BACK AS LONG AS SHE KNEW THAT HER CLOTHES WERE FINER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND THAT SHE HAD MORE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER GIRL
1116-132851-0001 AND WHAT WAS WORSE OFTEN MADE FUN OF HIM WITH THE REST
1116-132851-0002 ONE EVENING HE WAS BRINGING BACK HIS HORSES FROM THE FIELDS AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE LAKE ON THE WAY HOME TO LET THEM DRINK HE WAS TIRED WITH A LONG DAY'S WORK AND STOOD WITH HIS HAND ON THE MANE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS WAITING TILL THEY HAD DONE AND THINKING ALL THE WHILE OF BARBAIK
1116-132851-0003 WHEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE GORSE CLOSE BY
1116-132851-0004 IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
1116-132851-0005 AND EVEN WHICH IS MUCH HARDER BE INVISIBLE IF I WANT TO THEN SHOW YOURSELF TO ME IN THE SHAPE IN WHICH YOUR FAMILY GENERALLY APPEAR REPLIED JEGU CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH AND THE FROG JUMPED ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE HORSES AND CHANGED INTO A LITTLE DWARF ALL DRESSED IN GREEN
1116-132851-0006 AT FIRST UNDER DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHAPES SINCE THAT TIME PARTLY FROM HABIT AND PARTLY TO AMUSE OURSELVES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES AND IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU HOW EXCLAIMED JEGU FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT
1116-132851-0007 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
1116-132851-0008 JEGU DECLARED THAT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER AND THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT HE THANKED THE DWARF HEARTILY AND LED HIS HORSES BACK TO THE FARM NEXT MORNING WAS A HOLIDAY AND BARBAIK WAS AWAKE EARLIER THAN USUAL
1116-132851-0009 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0010 THE RACKS FILLED WITH HAY THE COWS MILKED AND THE PAILS STANDING NEATLY IN A ROW
1116-132851-0011 AND WHEN SHE MET HIM OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHE STOPPED AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS HELP TO BE SURE JEGU ONLY REPLIED ROUGHLY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT THIS ANSWER MADE HER FEEL ALL THE MORE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HE AND NOBODY ELSE
1116-132851-0012 INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
1116-132851-0013 AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
1116-132851-0014 WHY AM I NOT ALREADY BACK FROM MORLAIX WITH MY MILK POT EMPTY MY BUTTER BOWL INSIDE IT A POUND OF WILD CHERRIES ON MY WOODEN PLATE AND THE MONEY I HAVE GAINED IN MY APRON POCKET AND IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE GOT UP LO AND BEHOLD
1116-132851-0015 AND SIX NEW PIECES OF SILVER IN THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALL THIS WAS OWING TO JEGU AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS WHEN THINGS HAD REACHED THIS PASS THE BROWNIE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE HAD BETTER ASK BARBAIK TO MARRY HIM
1116-132851-0016 AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
1116-132851-0017 AND SHE COULD SLEEP EVERY MORNING TILL BREAKFAST TIME JUST LIKE A YOUNG LADY AND AS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
1116-132851-0018 SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
1116-132851-0019 BARBAIK WAS FURIOUS
1116-132851-0020 HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE AGAINST THE BROWNIE WHO HAD CAUSED HER TO EXPECT A LIFE OF EASE AND PLEASURE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT JEGU AND BEHELD HIS RED FACE SQUINTING EYES AND UNTIDY HAIR HER ANGER WAS DOUBLED
1116-132851-0021 WHILE NOW I CAN RECEIVE NO PRESENTS EXCEPT FROM MY HUSBAND I CAN NEVER DANCE EXCEPT WITH MY HUSBAND OH YOU WRETCHED DWARF I WILL NEVER NEVER FORGIVE YOU IN SPITE OF HER FIERCE WORDS NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN BARBAIK HOW TO PUT HER PRIDE IN HER POCKET WHEN IT SUITED HER
1116-132851-0022 AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
1116-132851-0023 SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN THE HORSE APPEARED AND MOUNTING ON HIS BACK SHE STARTED FOR THE VILLAGE WHERE THE WEDDING WAS TO BE HELD AT FIRST SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE CHANCE OF A HOLIDAY FROM THE WORK WHICH SHE HATED THAT SHE NOTICED NOTHING
1116-132851-0024 BUT VERY SOON IT STRUCK HER AS ODD THAT AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROADS FULL OF PEOPLE THEY ALL LAUGHED AS THEY LOOKED AT HER HORSE AT LENGTH SHE CAUGHT SOME WORDS UTTERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER WHY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS SOLD HER HORSE'S TAIL AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
1116-132851-0025 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE HE DECLINED TO MOVE OUT OF A WALK
1116-132851-0026 SO ONE DAY THE BROWNIE ASKED JEGU IF HE MIGHT BRING HIS FRIENDS TO HAVE SUPPER IN THE GREAT BARN AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DANCE THERE OF COURSE JEGU WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROWNIE AND HE ORDERED BARBAIK TO SPREAD HER BEST TABLE CLOTHS IN THE BARN
1116-132851-0027 WHEN ALL WAS READY THE DWARFS IN NEW GREEN SUITS CAME BUSTLING IN VERY HAPPY AND MERRY AND TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE BUT IN A MOMENT THEY ALL SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN AWAY SCREAMING FOR BARBAIK HAD PLACED PANS OF HOT COALS UNDER THEIR FEET AND ALL THEIR POOR LITTLE TOES WERE BURNT
1116-132851-0028 YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
