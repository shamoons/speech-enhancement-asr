1235-135884-0000 WHAT IS MORE MY WIFE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN I MARRIED HER SO THAT I MAY JUSTLY SAY SHE OUGHT TO REGARD ME EQUALLY AS HER FATHER HER KINSMAN AND HER HUSBAND
1235-135884-0001 WE LIVED TOGETHER TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT ANY CHILDREN HER BARRENNESS DID NOT EFFECT ANY CHANGE IN MY LOVE I STILL TREATED HER WITH MUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION
1235-135884-0002 MY DESIRE OF HAVING CHILDREN ONLY INDUCED ME TO PURCHASE A SLAVE BY WHOM I HAD A SON WHO WAS EXTREMELY PROMISING MY WIFE BEING JEALOUS CHERISHED A HATRED FOR BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0003 BUT CONCEALED HER AVERSION SO WELL THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS TOO LATE MEAN TIME MY SON GREW UP AND WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE A LONG JOURNEY
1235-135884-0004 BEFORE I WENT I RECOMMENDED TO MY WIFE OF WHOM I HAD NO MISTRUST THE SLAVE AND HER SON AND PRAYED HER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DURING MY ABSENCE WHICH WAS TO BE FOR A WHOLE YEAR
1235-135884-0005 SHE HOWEVER EMPLOYED THAT TIME TO SATISFY HER HATRED SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO MAGIC
1235-135884-0006 THE WRETCH CARRIED MY SON TO A DESOLATE PLACE WHERE BY HER ENCHANTMENTS SHE CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AND GAVE HIM TO MY FARMER TO FATTEN PRETENDING SHE HAD BOUGHT HIM
1235-135884-0007 HER ENMITY DID NOT STOP AT THIS ABOMINABLE ACTION BUT SHE LIKEWISE CHANGED THE SLAVE INTO A COW AND GAVE HER ALSO TO MY FARMER AT MY RETURN I ENQUIRED FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0008 YOUR SLAVE SAID SHE IS DEAD AND AS FOR YOUR SON I KNOW NOT WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THIS TWO MONTHS I WAS AFFLICTED AT THE DEATH OF THE SLAVE
1235-135884-0009 BUT AS SHE INFORMED ME MY SON HAD ONLY DISAPPEARED I WAS IN HOPES HE WOULD SHORTLY RETURN HOWEVER EIGHT MONTHS PASSED AND I HEARD NOTHING OF HIM WHEN THE FESTIVAL OF THE GREAT BAIRAM WAS TO BE CELEBRATED
1235-135884-0010 THE UNFORTUNATE MOTHER OF MY SON I BOUND HER BUT AS I WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE HER SHE BELLOWED PITEOUSLY AND I COULD PERCEIVE TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES THIS SEEMED TO ME VERY EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135884-0011 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135884-0012 AND RESISTING AN ORDER WHICH DISAPPOINTED HER MALICE SHE CRIED OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUSBAND SACRIFICE THAT COW YOUR FARMER HAS NOT A FINER NOR ONE FITTER FOR THE FESTIVAL OUT OF DEFERENCE TO MY WIFE I CAME AGAIN TO THE COW
1235-135884-0013 AND COMBATING MY COMPASSION WHICH SUSPENDED THE SACRIFICE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER THE FATAL BLOW WHEN THE VICTIM REDOUBLING HER TEARS AND BELLOWING DISARMED ME A SECOND TIME
1235-135884-0014 I THEN PUT THE MALLET INTO THE FARMER'S HANDS AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE IT AND SACRIFICE HER HIMSELF FOR HER TEARS AND BELLOWING PIERCED MY HEART THE FARMER LESS COMPASSIONATE THAN MYSELF SACRIFICED HER
1235-135884-0015 THOUGH TO SHE SEEMED VERY FAT TAKE HER YOURSELF SAID I TO HIM
1235-135884-0016 I DID NOT ENQUIRE WHAT HE DID WITH THE COW BUT SOON AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HER AWAY HE RETURNED WITH A FAT CALF THOUGH I KNEW NOT THE CALF WAS MY SON YET I COULD NOT FORBEAR BEING MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM ON HIS PART
1235-135884-0017 AS SOON AS HE BEHELD ME HE MADE SO GREAT AN EFFORT TO COME NEAR ME THAT HE BROKE HIS CORD
1235-135884-0018 WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND AS IF HE MEANT TO EXCITE MY COMPASSION CONJURING ME NOT TO BE SO CRUEL AS TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND DID AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SIGNIFY THAT HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0019 I WAS MORE SURPRISED AND AFFECTED WITH THIS ACTION THAN WITH THE TEARS OF THE COW I FELT A TENDER PITY WHICH INTERESTED ME ON HIS BEHALF OR RATHER NATURE DID ITS DUTY
1235-135884-0020 GO SAID I TO THE FARMER CARRY HOME THAT CALF TAKE GREAT CARE OF HIM AND BRING ME ANOTHER IN HIS STEAD IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS MY WIFE HEARD ME GIVE THIS ORDER SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HUSBAND
1235-135884-0021 TAKE MY ADVICE SACRIFICE NO OTHER CALF BUT THAT WIFE I REPLIED I WILL NOT SACRIFICE HIM I WILL SPARE HIM AND PRAY DO NOT YOU OPPOSE ME
1235-135884-0022 THE WICKED WOMAN HAD NO REGARD TO MY WISHES SHE HATED MY SON TOO MUCH TO CONSENT THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM I TIED THE POOR CREATURE AND TAKING UP THE FATAL KNIFE WAS GOING TO PLUNGE IT INTO MY SON'S THROAT
1235-135884-0023 WHEN TURNING HIS EYES BATHED WITH TEARS IN A LANGUISHING MANNER TOWARDS ME HE AFFECTED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAD NOT STRENGTH TO KILL HIM I LET THE KNIFE FALL AND TOLD MY WIFE POSITIVELY
1235-135884-0024 THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
1235-135884-0025 I COME SAID HE TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU A PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL RETURN ME THANKS I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT HAS SOME SKILL IN MAGIC YESTERDAY
1235-135884-0026 THESE TWO METAMORPHOSES WERE MADE BY THE ENCHANTMENTS OF OUR MASTER'S WIFE WHO HATED BOTH THE MOTHER
1235-135884-0027 THIS IS WHAT MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME SAID THE FARMER AND I COME TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH IT I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE HOW MUCH I WAS SURPRISED I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MY FARMER TO SPEAK TO HIS DAUGHTER MYSELF
1235-135884-0028 AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I WENT FORTHWITH TO THE STALL WHERE MY SON WAS KEPT HE COULD NOT RETURN MY EMBRACES BUT RECEIVED THEM IN SUCH A MANNER AS FULLY SATISFIED ME HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0029 MY GOOD MAID SAID I CAN YOU RESTORE MY SON TO HIS FORMER SHAPE YES SHE REPLIED I CAN
1235-135884-0030 EXCEPT ON TWO CONDITIONS THE FIRST IS THAT YOU GIVE HIM TO ME FOR MY HUSBAND AND THE SECOND THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO PUNISH THE PERSON WHO CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AS TO THE FIRST I REPLIED
1235-135884-0031 AS TO WHAT RELATES TO MY WIFE I ALSO AGREE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN CAPABLE OF COMMITTING SUCH A CRIMINAL ACTION JUSTLY DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED
1235-135884-0032 ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
1235-135884-0033 PROVIDED YOU FIRST OF ALL RESTORE TO ME MY SON
1235-135884-0034 PRONOUNCED OVER IT WORDS THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO THE CALF O CALF IF THOU WEST CREATED BY THE ALMIGHTY AND SOVEREIGN MASTER OF THE WORLD SUCH AS THOU APPEAREST AT THIS TIME CONTINUE IN THAT FORM
1235-135884-0035 BUT IF THOU BE A MAN AND ART CHANGED INTO A CALF BY ENCHANTMENT RETURN TO THY NATURAL SHAPE BY THE PERMISSION OF THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR AS SHE SPOKE SHE THREW WATER UPON HIM
1235-135884-0036 AND IN AN INSTANT HE RECOVERED HIS NATURAL FORM MY SON
1235-135884-0037 WITH SUCH A TRANSPORT OF JOY THAT I KNEW NOT WHAT I WAS DOING IT IS HEAVEN THAT HATH SENT US THIS YOUNG MAID TO REMOVE THE HORRIBLE CHARM BY WHICH YOU WERE ENCHANTED AND TO AVENGE THE INJURY DONE TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER I DOUBT NOT
1235-135884-0038 BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
1235-135884-0039 I DESIRED SHE MIGHT HAVE THIS SHAPE RATHER THAN ANOTHER LESS AGREEABLE THAT WE MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FAMILY WITHOUT HORROR SINCE THAT TIME MY SON IS BECOME A WIDOWER AND GONE TO TRAVEL
1235-135884-0040 IT BEING NOW SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I HEARD OF HIM I AM COME ABROAD TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM AND NOT BEING WILLING TO TRUST ANYBODY WITH MY WIFE TILL I SHOULD RETURN HOME I THOUGHT FIT TO TAKE HER EVERYWHERE WITH ME
1235-135884-0041 THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MYSELF AND THIS HIND IS IT NOT ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING I ADMIT IT IS SAID THE GENIE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT FORGIVE THE MERCHANT ONE THIRD OF HIS CRIME
