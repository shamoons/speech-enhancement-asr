1235-135887-0000 THE STORY OF THE GRECIAN KING
1235-135887-0001 THERE WAS IN THE COUNTRY OF YUNAUN OR GREECE A KING WHO WAS LEPROUS AND HIS PHYSICIANS HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED HIS CURE
1235-135887-0002 ARRIVED AT HIS COURT THIS PHYSICIAN HAD LEARNT THE THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREEK PERSIAN TURKISH ARABIC LATIN SYRIAC AND HEBREW BOOKS HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
1235-135887-0003 I KNOW SAID HE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIALS THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S PHYSICIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEAL YOU OF THE LEPROSY BUT IF YOU WILL ACCEPT MY SERVICE I WILL ENGAGE TO CURE YOU WITHOUT POTIONS
1235-135887-0004 OR EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS THE KING LISTENED TO WHAT HE SAID AND ANSWERED IF YOU BE ABLE TO PERFORM WHAT YOU PROMISE I WILL ENRICH YOU AND YOUR POSTERITY
1235-135887-0005 DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
1235-135887-0006 AND TO MORROW WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED TO HIS QUARTERS MADE A HOLLOW MACE AND AT THE HANDLE HE PUT IN HIS DRUGS
1235-135887-0007 WITH WHICH NEXT MORNING HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING AND FALLING DOWN AT HIS FEET KISSED THE GROUND
1235-135887-0008 AND AFTER A PROFOUND REVERENCE SAID TO THE KING HE JUDGED IT MEET THAT HIS MAJESTY SHOULD TAKE HORSE
1235-135887-0009 THE KING DID SO AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM WITH THE MACE AND SAID EXERCISE YOURSELF WITH THIS MACE AND STRIKE THE BALL UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR HANDS AND BODY PERSPIRE
1235-135887-0010 WHEN THE MEDICINE I HAVE PUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE IS HEATED WITH YOUR HAND IT WILL PENETRATE YOUR WHOLE BODY AND AS SOON AS YOU PERSPIRE YOU MAY LEAVE OFF THE EXERCISE
1235-135887-0011 IMMEDIATELY ON YOUR RETURN TO YOUR PALACE GO INTO THE BATH AND CAUSE YOURSELF TO BE WELL WASHED AND RUBBED THEN RETIRE TO BED AND WHEN YOU RISE TO MORROW YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF CURED
1235-135887-0012 THE KING TOOK THE MACE AND STRUCK THE BALL WHICH WAS RETURNED BY HIS OFFICERS WHO PLAYED WITH HIM HE PLAYED SO LONG THAT HIS HANDS AND HIS WHOLE BODY WERE IN A SWEAT AND THEN THE MEDICINE SHUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE HAD ITS OPERATION
1235-135887-0013 AS THE PHYSICIAN HAD SAID UPON THIS THE KING LEFT OFF PLAY RETURNED TO HIS PALACE ENTERED THE BATH AND OBSERVED VERY EXACTLY HIS PHYSICIAN HAD PRESCRIBED TO HIM
1235-135887-0014 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AROSE HE PERCEIVED WITH EQUAL WONDER AND JOY THAT HIS LEPROSY WAS CURED AND HIS BODY AS CLEAN AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN AFFECTED AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE CAME INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE WHERE HE ASCENDED HIS THRONE
1235-135887-0015 AND SHEWED HIMSELF TO HIS COURTIERS WHO EAGER TO KNOW THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICINE CAME THITHER BETIMES AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING PERFECTLY CURED EXPRESSED GREAT JOY
1235-135887-0016 BOWED HIMSELF BEFORE THE THRONE WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THE KING PERCEIVING HIM MADE HIM SIT DOWN BY HIS SIDE PRESENTED HIM TO THE ASSEMBLY AND GAVE HIM ALL THE COMMENDATION HE DESERVED
1235-135887-0017 BUT AS HE TREATED ALL HIS COURT THAT DAY MADE HIM EAT AT HIS TABLE ALONE WITH HIM
1235-135887-0018 BUT CAUSED HIM TO BE CLAD IN A RICH ROBE
1235-135887-0019 CONTINUED EVERY DAY TO LOAD HIM WITH NEW FAVOURS BUT THIS KING HAD A VIZIER WHO WAS AVARICIOUS ENVIOUS AND NATURALLY CAPABLE OF EVERY KIND OF MISCHIEF
1235-135887-0020 HE COULD NOT BEHOLD WITHOUT ENVY THE PRESENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE PHYSICIAN WHOSE OTHER MERITS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
1235-135887-0021 TO EFFECT THIS HE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM IN PRIVATE THAT HE HAD SOME INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMMUNICATE THE KING HAVING ASKED WHAT IT WAS SIRE SAID HE
1235-135887-0022 IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS FOR A MONARCH TO CONFIDE IN A MAN WHOSE FIDELITY HE HAS NEVER TRIED
1235-135887-0023 I AM WELL INFORMED OF WHAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO REVEAL TO YOUR MAJESTY THEREFORE DO NOT REST IN DANGEROUS SECURITY IF YOUR MAJESTY BE ASLEEP BE PLEASED TO AWAKE
1235-135887-0024 AND CAME TO SETTLE HIMSELF AT YOUR COURT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXECUTING THE HORRIBLE DESIGN WHICH I HAVE INTIMATED NO NO VIZIER INTERRUPTED THE KING
1235-135887-0025 I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
1235-135887-0026 IF HE HAD HAD A DESIGN UPON MY LIFE WHY DID HE SAVE ME THEN HE NEEDED ONLY TO HAVE LEFT ME TO MY DISEASE I COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED IT AS LIFE WAS FAST DECAYING FORBEAR THEN TO FILL ME WITH UNJUST SUSPICIONS
1235-135887-0027 INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU I TELL YOU THAT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD I WILL GIVE THAT GREAT MAN A PENSION OF A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD PER MONTH FOR HIS LIFE NAY THOUGH I WERE TO SHARE WITH HIM ALL MY RICHES AND DOMINIONS
1235-135887-0028 I SHOULD NEVER PAY HIM SUFFICIENTLY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE I PERCEIVE IT TO BE HIS VIRTUE THAT RAISES YOUR ENVY BUT DO NOT THINK I WILL BE UNJUSTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM I REMEMBER TOO WELL WHAT A VIZIER SAID TO KING SINBAD HIS MASTER
1235-135887-0029 TO PREVENT HIS PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRINCE HIS SON WHAT THE GRECIAN KING SAID ABOUT KING SINBAD RAISED THE VIZIER'S CURIOSITY WHO SAID I PRAY YOUR MAJESTY TO PARDON ME
1235-135887-0030 IF I HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO ASK WHAT THE VIZIER OF KING SINBAD SAID TO HIS MASTER TO DIVERT HIM FROM PUTTING THE PRINCE HIS SON TO DEATH THE GRECIAN KING HAD THE CONDESCENSION TO SATISFY HIM THAT VIZIER SAID HE
1235-135887-0031 AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED TO KING SINBAD THAT HE OUGHT TO BEWARE LEST ON THE ACCUSATION OF A MOTHER IN LAW HE SHOULD COMMIT AN ACTION OF WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS REPENT
