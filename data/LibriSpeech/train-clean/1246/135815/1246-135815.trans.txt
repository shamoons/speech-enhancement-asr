1246-135815-0012 PETER WAS DELIGHTED TO AIR HIS KNOWLEDGE THE LAST ONE I WAS IN SAID HE WAS A LONG TUNNEL SLANTING DOWN FOR QUITE A DISTANCE AND THEN STRAIGHTENING OUT THE ENTRANCE WAS QUITE LARGE WITH A BIG HEAP OF SAND OUT IN FRONT OF IT
1246-135815-0013 DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
1246-135815-0014 AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
