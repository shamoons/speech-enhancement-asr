125-121342-0000 A FATHOM DEEP IN SLEEP I LIE WITH OLD DESIRES RESTRAINED BEFORE TO CLAMOR LIFEWARD WITH A CRY AS DARK FLIES OUT THE GREYING DOOR AND SO IN QUEST OF CREEDS TO SHARE I SEEK ASSERTIVE DAY AGAIN
125-121342-0001 BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
125-121342-0002 THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
125-121342-0003 IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
125-121342-0004 THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
125-121342-0005 HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
125-121342-0006 CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
125-121342-0007 THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
125-121342-0008 FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
125-121342-0009 A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0011 THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
125-121342-0012 AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
125-121342-0013 AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
125-121342-0014 LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
125-121342-0015 IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
125-121342-0016 AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
125-121342-0017 HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
125-121342-0018 AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
125-121342-0019 HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
125-121342-0020 NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
125-121342-0021 MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
