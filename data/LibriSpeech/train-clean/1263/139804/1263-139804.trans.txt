1263-139804-0000 SUSTAINS THE SHORTEST LIVED HUMAN BEINGS OF OUR UNIVERSE IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY OF THE CREATURES REACH MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS OF TIME
1263-139804-0001 THEY ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WE AND RELATIVELY MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT ALL THE PERIODS OF PHYSICAL GROWTH ARE CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED CHILDREN WALK FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
1263-139804-0002 AND ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING REGULAR INSTRUCTION AT THE AGE OF FIVE MONTHS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THIS SPHERE WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL CALL BRIEF
1263-139804-0003 REVOLVES VERY SLOWLY ON ITS AXIS SO THAT OUR WORLD MAKES FIFTEEN TIMES AS MANY REVOLUTIONS AS THIS PLANET IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE ARITHMETIC TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF DO NOT SEE THE SUN RISE VERY OFTEN
1263-139804-0004 ON THIS WORLD OF BRIEF ALL VEGETABLES MATURE IN PERIODS SO SHORT THAT ONE MARVELS WHEN HE HEARS IT THINK OF CEREALS REACHING MATURITY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR DAYS OR DURING ONE DAY OF BRIEF
1263-139804-0005 EARLY IN THE MORNING CERTAIN CROPS ARE PLANTED AND ARE HARVESTED AT NIGHT TWO OR MORE DAYS ARE REQUIRED FOR MATURING OTHER CROPS ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF RAISE THEIR CROPS WITH LESS LABOR THAN IS REQUIRED AMONGST US
1263-139804-0006 IF YOU WERE PERMITTED TO LOOK UPON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORLD YOUR FIRST SENSATION WOULD BE DIZZINESS NOT TO MENTION THE WEIRDNESS OF ALL SIGHTS THAT WOULD CONFRONT YOU AT EVERY TURN
1263-139804-0007 AND IF BY LEASE OF STRENGTH THEY PASS ON TOWARD AN AGE OF FOUR YEARS IT IS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL VITALITY IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG LIFE OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY YEARS IS CROWDED INTO A NARROW COMPASS OF FOUR YEARS
1263-139804-0008 THERE BEING NO COMPETITION NO TIME OR SPACE IS REQUIRED FOR SENSATIONAL TRASH THUS IF NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURS NOTHING NEED BE TRANSMITTED THE OFFICIAL NEWS CENSORS DECIDE AS TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OCCURRENCES
1263-139804-0009 THERE NEED NOT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NEWS TELEGRAPHED EACH HOUR THE GOVERNMENT VERIFIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL REPORTS BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSMITTED THERE ARE INDEED SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH HOME UNDER ITS CARE
1263-139804-0010 THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT PAYS NEARLY ALL EXPENSES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF JOURNALISM ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR PRIVATE GAIN ARE PAID AT A REGULAR RATE IT COSTS MORE TO ADVERTISE AT CERTAIN PERIODS THAN AT OTHER TIMES
1263-139804-0011 THEY NEVER THINK OF COVERING THE FEET UNDER ANY CHANGE OF CLIMATE IF ONE OF THE BRIEFITES WERE TO STEP UPON THE SHORES OF OUR RUGGED EARTH AND SEE THE COTTON OR WOOL AND LEATHER THAT LIES AROUND OUR FEET IT WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IMAGINABLE
1263-139804-0012 NEITHER THE MEN WOMEN NOR CHILDREN SEEM TO SEEK THIS MEANS FOR SELF BEAUTIFYING THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BEAUTY OF CHARACTER HAS A RADIANCE MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THE FLASH OF OPALS OR THE LUSTER OF SILKS THEIR GARMENTS PARTAKE OF THE LOOSE FLOWING ORDER
1263-139804-0013 FOR INSTANCE A STRONG FABRIC OF CHOSEN SHADE IS FASTENED AT THE NECK HIP KNEE AND ANKLE AND LIES CARELESSLY OVER THE PARTS BETWEEN THE FEMALES NEVER GRADUATED TO THE CORSET DEGREE AND WHILE THEY DO NOT CUT A SCIENTIFIC FIGURE
1263-139804-0014 TRANSPORTATION THE METHODS OF TRAVELING ARE SO CONTRARY TO OUR CONCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT I ALMOST FORBEAR TO ATTEMPT ANY DESCRIPTION
1263-139804-0015 WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
1263-139804-0016 ALTHOUGH THE CARS RUN ON WHEELS THE CAR IS RAISED IN A SHAFT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THEN BY GRAVITY IT DASHES TWO OR MORE MILES ACCORDING TO THE LAY OF THE LAND TRAVERSED THEN ANOTHER RISE MORE OR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET IS EXPERIENCED
1263-139804-0017 AND THEN ANOTHER WILD DASH I HAVE NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR THIS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE BRIEFITES CAN COVER CONSIDERABLE TERRITORY IN AN HOUR THEY LOOK UPON THIS GRAVITY SYSTEM AS A WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1263-139804-0018 THE POWER OF STEAM HAS NEVER BEEN UTILIZED NO GENIUS OF ALL THIS ACTIVE WORLD OF BRIEF EVER CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER LIES WRAPPED UP IN THIN VAPORY WATER BUT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL GASEOUS OIL
1263-139804-0019 AND HAVE LEARNED TO PUT IT TO WORK SO THAT IT IS THE MAIN FORCE EMPLOYED IN HOISTING AND ALL OTHER PURPOSES WHERE POWER IS REQUIRED NOTHING LIKE A TRAVELING LOCOMOTIVE HAS EVER BEEN MADE ALTHOUGH I LEARNED THAT A BRIGHT WIZARD WAS EXPERIMENTING
1263-139804-0020 AND THAT HE PROPHESIED GREAT CHANGES WHEN HIS GAS PROPELLED VEHICLE WAS PERFECTED THINK OF HOW MUCH VALUE AN ORDINARY CITIZEN OF OUR WORLD WOULD BE TO THESE BRIEFITES IF HE COULD STEP UPON THEIR WORLD AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM CONCERNING THE MAGIC WONDERS OF STEAM
1263-139804-0021 AND THE MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING STATIONARY AND MOVABLE ENGINES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HIDDEN WONDERS OF ELECTRICITY QUADRUPEDS THAT TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR HORSES ARE USED FOR DRAYAGE ALTHOUGH NOTHING EXCEPT THE TWO WHEELED CLASS OF VEHICLES WAS EVER USED UNTIL SOME EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS AGO
1263-139804-0022 PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
1263-139804-0023 IN ALL MY VAST JOURNEY AMONG THE WORLDS I FOUND ONLY A FEW COMPARATIVELY WHEREON THE ROADS WERE INFERIOR TO OURS IN THE WORLD OF BRIEF THE STATE PRESCRIBES THE MANNER OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND EACH CITIZEN MUST CONTRIBUTE HIS SHARE TO THEIR CREATION AND MAINTENANCE
1263-139804-0024 VERY INTRICATE AND ELABORATE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BY THESE PEOPLE OF A FEW YEARS THEY ARE INFERIOR TO US IN A HUNDRED WAYS IN THE BROAD FIELDS OF MANUFACTURE AND INVENTION THEY LAG A LONG DISTANCE IN THE REAR THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TIME
1263-139804-0025 RELIGIOUS LIFE THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF IS ON AN AVERAGE OF A HIGHER TYPE THAN IS FOUND IN OUR WORLD THEIR BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY HAS RUN PARALLEL WITH THEIR EXISTENCE AS A PEOPLE
1263-139804-0026 THE MOST FAITHFUL TRANSLATION OF THIS WORD INTO OUR LANGUAGE WOULD BE GOD AFFLUENCE KERM CHER OR GOD BREATH APPEARED UPON BRIEF FULL GROWN
1263-139804-0027 SIMILAR TO CHRIST HE CONFIRMED HIS IDENTITY BY UNANSWERABLE MIRACLES MANY HOWEVER DISBELIEVED IN KERM CHER AND HELD TO THE OLD AXIOMATIC TRUTHS THUS CREEDS WERE PREVALENT AND THEY REMAIN UNTIL NOW
1263-139804-0028 ONLY THERE IS MUCH LESS VARIETY THAN IS FOUND AMONGST US KERM CHER SET UP A NEW REIGN AND ACCEPTED A TEMPORAL THRONE FOR A SEASON HE FINALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS AMBASSADORSHIP WOULD SOON CEASE
1263-139804-0029 AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
