1263-141777-0000 MOISTURE FROM THE NIGHT'S RAIN HUNG ON THE TREE LEAVES CLUNG IN GLOBULES TO RYNCH'S SWEATING BODY HE LAY ON A WIDE BRANCH TRYING TO CONTROL THE HEAVY PANTING WHICH SUPPLIED HIS LABORING LUNGS
1263-141777-0001 AND HE COULD STILL HEAR THE ECHOES OF THE STARTLED CRIES WHICH HAD COME FROM THE MEN WHO HAD THREADED THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE UP POINTED TAIL FINS OF THE L B NOW HE TRIED TO REASON WHY HE HAD RUN THEY WERE HIS OWN KIND
1263-141777-0002 THEY WOULD TAKE HIM OUT OF THE LONELINESS OF A WORLD HERETOFORE EMPTY OF HIS SPECIES BUT THAT TALL MAN THE ONE WHO HAD LED THE PARTY INTO THE IRREGULAR CLEARING ABOUT THE LIFE BOAT RYNCH SHIVERED
1263-141777-0003 DUG HIS NAILS INTO THE WOOD ON WHICH HE LAY AT THE SIGHT OF THAT MAN DREAM AND REALITY HAD CRASHED TOGETHER SENDING HIM INTO PANIC STRICKEN FLIGHT THAT WAS THE MAN FROM THE ROOM
1263-141777-0004 THE MAN WITH THE CUP AS HIS HEART QUIETED HE BEGAN TO THINK MORE COHERENTLY FIRST HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE STRONG JAWS'S DEN
1263-141777-0005 THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0007 THOUGH IT WAS BALLED IN UPON ITSELF HE WAS SURE THE CREATURE WAS FULLY AS LARGE AS HE AND THE MENACING CLAWS SUGGESTED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WHEN IT MADE NO MOVE TO FOLLOW HIM
1263-141777-0008 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0009 NONE CAME AND HE DARED TO SLIP AROUND THE BOLE OF THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR ANY CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OVERHEAD NOW HE WAS FACING THAT SURVIVOR'S CAMP
1263-141777-0010 ANOTHER OBJECT CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF THE LEAN TO SHELTER JUST AS ITS FELLOW WAS ON SENTRY DUTY IN THE TREE ONLY THIS ONE DID NOT HAVE THE SELF COLOR OF THE FOLIAGE TO DISGUISE IT FOUR LIMBED ITS LONG FOREARMS CURVED ABOUT ITS BENT KNEES
1263-141777-0011 AND THE SENSE ORGANS OF EYES AND NOSE SQUEEZED TOGETHER ON THE LOWER QUARTER OF THE ROUNDED PORTION WITH A LINE OF WIDE MOUTH TO SPLIT THE BLUNT ROUND OF THE MUZZLE DARK PITS FOR EYES SHOWED NO PUPIL IRIS OR CORNEA
1263-141777-0012 THE NOSE WAS A BLACK PERFECTLY ROUNDED TUBE JUTTING AN INCH OR SO BEYOND THE CHEEK SURFACE GROTESQUE ALIEN AND TERRIFYING IT MADE NO HOSTILE MOVE AND SINCE IT HAD NOT TURNED ITS HEAD HE COULD NOT BE SURE IT HAD EVEN SIGHTED HIM
1263-141777-0013 BUT IT KNEW HE WAS THERE HE WAS CERTAIN OF THAT AND WAS WAITING FOR WHAT AS THE LONG SECONDS CRAWLED BY RYNCH BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT WAITING FOR HIM HEARTENED HE PULLED AT THE VINE LOOP
1263-141777-0014 CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TREE MINUTES LATER HE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO OF THE BEASTS WAITING QUIETLY ABOUT THE CAMP AND THAT THEIR SENTRY LINE RAN BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLEARING OF THE L B HE WITHDREW FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
1263-141777-0015 INTENT UPON FINDING A DETOUR WHICH WOULD BRING HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN LANDS NOW HE WANTED TO JOIN FORCES WITH HIS OWN KIND WHETHER THOSE MEN WERE POTENTIAL ENEMIES OR NOT AS TIME PASSED THE BEASTS CLOSED ABOUT THE CLEARING OF THE CAMP
1263-141777-0016 AFTERNOON WAS FADING INTO EVENING WHEN HE REACHED A POINT SEVERAL MILES DOWNSTREAM NEAR THE RIVER SINCE HE HAD COME INTO THE OPEN HE HAD NOT SIGHTED ANY OF THE WATCHERS HE HOPED THEY DID NOT WILLINGLY VENTURE OUT OF THE TREES WHERE THE LEAVES WERE THEIR PROTECTION
1263-141777-0017 RYNCH WENT FLAT ON THE STREAM BANK MADE A WORM'S PROGRESS UP THE SLOPE TO CROUCH BEHIND A BUSH AND SURVEY THE LAND IMMEDIATELY AHEAD THERE STOOD AN OFF WORLD SPACER FINS DOWN NOSE SKYWARD
1263-141777-0018 AND GROUPED NOT TOO FAR FROM ITS LANDING RAMP A COLLECTION OF BUBBLE TENTS A FIRE BURNED IN THEIR MIDST AND MEN WERE MOVING ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE WOOD AND ITS WATCHERS AND HAD COME SO NEAR TO HIS GOAL
1263-141777-0019 RYNCH WAS CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO DO THE SENSIBLE THING TO RISE OUT OF CONCEALMENT AND WALK UP TO THAT FIRE TO CLAIM RESCUE BY HIS OWN KIND THE MAN HE SOUGHT STOOD BY THE FIRE
1263-141777-0020 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0021 THAT IDEA MADE SENSE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LET THE OTHER PAST HIM FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND UNTIL HE WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CAMP SO THAT HIS FRIENDS COULD NOT INTERFERE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING
1263-141777-0022 IN SPITE OF HIS CAUTION RYNCH WAS CLOSE TO BETRAYAL AS HE EDGED AROUND A CLUMP OF VEGETATION GROWING HALF IN HALF OUT OF THE STREAM ONLY A TIMELY RUSTLE TOLD HIM THAT THE OTHER HAD SAT DOWN ON A DRIFT LOG WAITING FOR HIM RYNCH FROZE
1263-141777-0023 SO STARTLED THAT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY FOR A SECOND THEN HE NOTED THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE OTHER'S BODY WAS VISIBLE GROWING BRIGHTER BY THE MOMENT MINUTE PARTICLES OF PALE GREENISH RADIANCE WERE GATHERING ABOUT THE OTHER THE DARK SHADOW OF AN ARM FLAPPED THE RADIANCE SWIRLED
1263-141777-0024 BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
1263-141777-0025 HE CONTINUED TO KEEP THEM WHIRLING BY MEANS OF WAVING HAND AND ARM BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH LIGHT TO SHOW RYNCH THE FINGERS OF HIS OTHER HAND BUSY ON THE FRONT PANEL OF THE BOX HE WORE THAT FINGERING STOPPED THEN RYNCH'S HEAD CAME UP AS HE HEARD A VERY FAINT SOUND
1263-141777-0026 NOT A BEAST'S CRY OR WAS IT AGAIN THOSE FINGERS MOVED ON THE PANEL WAS THE OTHER SENDING A MESSAGE BY THAT MEANS RYNCH WATCHED HIM CHECK THE WEBBING COUNT THE EQUIPMENT AT HIS BELT SETTLE THE NEEDLER IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
1263-141777-0027 HOWEVER THE OTHER WAS AS WARY OF THAT DARK AS IF HE SUSPECTED WHAT MIGHT LIE IN WAIT THERE HE ANGLED ALONG NORTHWARD AVOIDING CLUMPS OF SCATTERED BRUSH KEEPING IN THE OPEN WHERE RYNCH DARED NOT TAIL HIM TOO CLOSELY
1263-141777-0028 THEIR COURSE PARALLEL TO THE WOODS BROUGHT THEM AT LAST TO A SECOND STREAM THE SIZE OF A RIVER INTO WHICH THE FIRST CREEK EMPTIED HERE THE OTHER SETTLED DOWN BETWEEN TWO ROCKS WITH EVERY INDICATION OF REMAINING THERE FOR A PERIOD
1263-141777-0029 THANKFULLY RYNCH FOUND HIS OWN LURKING PLACE FROM WHICH HE COULD KEEP THE OTHER IN SIGHT THE LIGHT POINTS GATHERED HUNG IN A SMALL LUMINOUS CLOUD OVER THE ROCKS BUT RYNCH HAD PRUDENTLY WITHDRAWN UNDER A BUSH
1263-141777-0030 AND THE SCENT OF ITS AROMATIC LEAVES MUST HAVE DISCOURAGED THE SPARKS FOR NO SUCH CROWN CAME TO HIS SENTRY POST DRUGGED WITH FATIGUE THE YOUNGER MAN SLEPT AWAKING TO FULL DAY A FOG OF BEWILDERMENT
1263-141777-0031 WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE OTHER'S EXPEDITION WAS HE GOING TO USE THE OPEN CUT THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN AS A WAY OF PENETRATING THE WOODED COUNTRY NOW RYNCH CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM FROM HIS OWN ANGLE THE MAN FROM THE SPACER HAD MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS TRAIL
1263-141777-0032 IN FACT IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM THAT HE HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO LEAVE BOOT PRINTS ON FAVORABLE STRETCHES OF GROUND DID HE GUESS THAT RYNCH LURKED BEHIND WAS NOW LEADING HIM ON FOR SOME PURPOSE OF HIS OWN
1263-141777-0033 OR WERE THOSE TRACES LEFT TO GUIDE ANOTHER PARTY FROM THE CAMP TO ADVANCE OPENLY UP THE STREAM BED WAS TO INVITE DISCOVERY RYNCH SURVEYED THE NEARER BANK CLUMPS OF SMALL TREES AND HIGH GROWING BUSHES DOTTED THAT EXPANSE AN IDEAL COVER
1263-141777-0034 THAT SOUND OF SNARLING SPITTING HATE ENDED IN MID CRY AS RYNCH CRAWLED TO THE RIVER BANK THE MAN FROM THE SPACER CAMP HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF A THREE PRONG ATTACK FROM A FEMALE AND HER CUBS
1263-141777-0035 THREE RED BODIES WERE FLAT AND STILL ON THE GRAVEL AS THE OFF WORLDER LEANED BACK AGAINST A ROCK BREATHING HEAVILY AS RYNCH SIGHTED HIM HE STOOPED TO RECOVER THE NEEDLER HE HAD DROPPED LURCHED AWAY FROM THE ROCK TOWARDS THE WATER
1263-141777-0036 CLAWED AT THE GROUND ABOUT HIM ALREADY HE WAS BURIED TO HIS KNEES THEN HIS MID THIGHS IN THE ARTIFICIAL QUICKSAND BUT HE HAD NOT LOST HIS HEAD AND WAS JERKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN AN EFFORT TO PULL FREE RYNCH GOT TO HIS FEET
1263-141777-0037 WALKED WITH SLOW DELIBERATION DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK THE TRAPPED PRISONER HAD SHIED HALFWAY AROUND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO FIND A FIRMER GRIP ON SOME ROCK LARGE AND HEAVY ENOUGH TO ANCHOR HIM AFTER HIS FIRST STARTLED CRY HE HAD MADE NO SOUND
1263-141777-0038 BUT NOW AS HE SIGHTED RYNCH HIS EYES WIDENED AND HIS LIPS PARTED THE BOX ON HIS CHEST CAUGHT ON A STONE HE HAD DRAGGED TO HIM IN A DESPERATE TRY FOR SUPPORT
1263-141777-0039 THERE WAS A SPITTING OF SPARKS AND THE STRANGER WORKED FRANTICALLY AT THE BUCKLE OF THE WEBBING HARNESS TO LOOSEN IT AND TOSS THE WHOLE THING FROM HIM THE BOX STRUCK ONE OF THE DEAD WATER CATS FLASHED AS FUR AND FLESH WERE SINGED
1263-141777-0040 RYNCH WATCHED DISPASSIONATELY BEFORE HE CAUGHT THE NEEDLER JERKING IT AWAY FROM THE PRISONER THE MAN EYED HIM STEADILY AND HIS EXPRESSION DID NOT ALTER EVEN WHEN RYNCH SWUNG THE OFF WORLD WEAPON TO CENTER ITS SIGHTS ON THE LATE OWNER
1263-141777-0041 SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED
