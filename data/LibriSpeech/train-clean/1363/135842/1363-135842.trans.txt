1363-135842-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM
1363-135842-0001 ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0002 EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
1363-135842-0003 ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
1363-135842-0004 WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
1363-135842-0005 WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
1363-135842-0006 WE UNS HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET SO WE UNS ARE FEELING PO'LY REPLIED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN A SUDDEN THOUGHT POPPED INTO PETER'S HEAD
1363-135842-0007 UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
1363-135842-0008 AM I A WHAT HE DEMANDED
1363-135842-0009 REPEATED PETER AH RECKONS AH MIGHT BE IF AH KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT AS LONG AS AH DON'T
1363-135842-0010 MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
1363-135842-0011 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0012 YET DOESN'T BELONG TO THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0013 CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
1363-135842-0014 ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
1363-135842-0015 I DON'T SEE WHY HE ISN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS IT IS BECAUSE HE BELONGS TO A GROUP WHICH HAS SOMETHING WHICH MAKES THEM ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND FOR THIS REASON
1363-135842-0016 THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER OF THEIR OWN EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY BELONG TO THE ORDER OF MARSUPIALS WHICH MEANS POUCHED ANIMALS
1363-135842-0017 IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
1363-135842-0018 THEY LOOK TOO FUNNY FOR ANYTHING THE OPOSSUMS ARE THE ONLY MARSUPIALS IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0019 NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
1363-135842-0020 JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
1363-135842-0021 CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
1363-135842-0022 AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
1363-135842-0023 AND WERE BLACK FOR THE LOWER HALF THE REST BEING WHITE HE HAD A LONG WHITISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT ALTOGETHER WITH HIS SHARP FACE AND NAKED TAIL
1363-135842-0024 HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
1363-135842-0025 SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
1363-135842-0026 THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
1363-135842-0027 AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
1363-135842-0028 I'M GLAD YOU DID REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU SEE THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE POSSUM FAMILY MEANWHILE OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS CLIMBING A TREE
1363-135842-0029 AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
1363-135842-0030 WHEN THE LITTLE POSSUMS CRAWLED OUT WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE SMALL THEY SIMPLY WRAPPED THEIR TAILS AROUND THE TWIGS TO KEEP FROM FALLING MY EXCLAIMED PETER
1363-135842-0031 THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0032 SUPPOSE YOU CLIMB A TREE UNC BILLY AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET THE EGGS FROM A NEST THAT YOU CANNOT REACH BY CRAWLING ALONG THE BRANCH ON WHICH IT IS PLACED SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE

1363-135842-0034 THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
1363-135842-0035 STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
1363-135842-0036 AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
