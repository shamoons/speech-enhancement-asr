1447-17506-0000 CHAPTER NINE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0001 AT DINNER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMOUS TARANTELLA WOULD BE DANCED IN THE LOWER HALL OF THE HOTEL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THE GIRLS TOLD UNCLE JOHN THAT THEY MUST NOT MISS THIS FAMOUS SIGHT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE IN SORRENTO OR INDEED IN ALL ITALY
1447-17506-0002 AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
1447-17506-0003 A GOODLY AUDIENCE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE ROOM AND AMONG THEM THE GIRL SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION SHE ADVANCED AND PLACED HER HAND IN THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD RISEN ON HER ENTRANCE AND HASTENED TOWARD HER
1447-17506-0004 HE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW BETH THOUGHT AND HAD A FOREIGN AND QUITE DISTINGUISHED AIR PRESENTLY LOUISE TURNED WITH CHEEKS SOMEWHAT FLUSHED AND BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN TO HER PARTY
1447-17506-0005 INTRODUCING HIM TO UNCLE JOHN AND HER COUSINS AS COUNT FERRALTI WHOM SHE HAD ONCE MET IN NEW YORK WHILE HE WAS ON A VISIT TO AMERICA
1447-17506-0006 THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0007 NEW YORK ADOPTS A GOOD MANY SAID UNCLE JOHN DRILY IT HAS EVEN BEEN THOUGHTLESS ENOUGH TO ADOPT ME THE DANCERS ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT AND THE AMERICANS WERE FORCED TO SEAT THEMSELVES HASTILY SO AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF OTHERS
1447-17506-0008 COUNT FERRALTI FOUND A PLACE BESIDE LOUISE BUT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE TO SAY TO HER DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE DANCES WERE UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BEING EXECUTED BY A TROUP OF LAUGHING PEASANTS DRESSED IN NATIVE COSTUME
1447-17506-0009 WHO SEEMED VERY PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ANXIOUS TO PLEASE THE THRONG OF TOURISTS PRESENT THE TARANTELLA ORIGINATED IN ISCHIA BUT SORRENTO AND CAPRI HAVE THE BEST DANCERS
1447-17506-0010 AFTERWARD UNCLE JOHN AND HIS NIECES STOOD UPON THE TERRACE AND WATCHED THE VOLCANO ROLLING ITS DENSE CLOUDS MINGLED WITH SPARKS OF RED HOT SCORIA TOWARD THE SKY
1447-17506-0011 THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
1447-17506-0012 AND BETH REPLIED THAT HIS MANNERS WERE SO LIKE THOSE OF THEIR COUSIN LOUISE THAT THE TWO OUGHT TO GET ALONG NICELY TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN LIKED HIS NIECES TO MAKE FRIENDS AND ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN GENERALLY TO MEET THEM
1447-17506-0013 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CALLOW ITALIAN NOBLEMAN THAT STAMPED HIS CHARACTER AS ARTIFICIAL AND INSINCERE HE RESOLVED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS BEFORE HE PERMITTED THE YOUNG FELLOW
1447-17506-0014 TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
1447-17506-0015 THAT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO TALK WITH THE MAN WHO SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY COURTEOUS TO HIS GUESTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN
1447-17506-0016 COUNT FERRALTI THE YOUNG MAN STANDING BY THE WINDOW YONDER I I DID NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY THE GENTLEMAN ARRIVED LAST EVENING AND I HAD NOT YET LEARNED HIS NAME LET ME SEE
1447-17506-0017 HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
1447-17506-0018 HE HAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS FERRALTI BUT ADDED NO TITLE A COUNT DID YOU SAY YES REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE PROPRIETOR LOOKED CURIOUSLY TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE BACK ONLY WAS VISIBLE
1447-17506-0019 THEN HE REMARKED THAT THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WAS WANING AND THE TROUBLE NEARLY OVER FOR THIS TIME
1447-17506-0020 THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU SIGNOR MERRICK OH PERHAPS YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF YOUR COUNTRY I I KNOW LITTLE OF THE NOBILITY ANSWERED FLORIANO INDIGNANTLY
1447-17506-0021 MY DEAR SIGNOR THERE IS NO MAN BETTER POSTED AS TO OUR NOBILITY IN ALL ITALY YET YOU SAY YOU DON'T KNOW THE FERRALTI FAMILY
1447-17506-0022 OBSERVE SIGNOR HERE IS OUR RECORD OF NOBILITY IT IS THE SAME AS THE BLUE BOOK OR THE PEERAGE OF ENGLAND EITHER FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SAY YOU HAVE NO NEED OF SUCH A BOOK IN AMERICA
1447-17506-0023 HE TURNED THE PAGES AND RAN HIS FINGER DOWN THE LINE OF FS FIND ME IF YOU CAN A COUNT FERRALTI IN THE LIST UNCLE JOHN LOOKED HE PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND LOOKED AGAIN
1447-17506-0024 AND NO SUCH NOBLE FAMILY SIGNOR MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A BOW I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR NAME LAST EVENING HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0025 AND THAT IS RIGHT SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY CARD UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE CARD AND READ CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI MILANO ITALIA
1447-17506-0026 HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE CARD IN HIS POCKET BOOK THANK YOU SAID HE IT'S A FINE MORNING COUNT CHARMING MISTER MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WALKED AWAY HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE YOUNG MAN UNJUSTLY
1447-17506-0027 WHEN AN IMPOSTURE IS UNMASKED IT IS NO LONGER DANGEROUS HE JOINED HIS NIECES WHO WERE ALL BUSILY ENGAGED IN WRITING LETTERS HOME AND REMARKED CASUALLY YOU'VE BEEN DECEIVED IN YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND LOUISE
1447-17506-0028 HE IS NEITHER A COUNT NOR OF NOBLE FAMILY ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU MET HIM IN NEW YORK HE HAD AN OBJECT IN POSING AS A TITLED ARISTOCRAT THE GIRL PAUSED EXAMINING THE POINT OF HER PEN THOUGHTFULLY
1447-17506-0029 HAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF HIM HOW SINGULAR EXCLAIMED LOUISE I WONDER WHY HE HAS TRIED TO DECEIVE US OH THE WORLD IS FULL OF IMPOSTORS BUT WHEN YOU ARE ON TO THEIR GAME THEY ARE QUITE HARMLESS
1447-17506-0030 UNCLE JOHN HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY FURTHER HE FELT HE WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION FOR LOUISE WAS THE MOST EXPERIENCED IN WORLDLY WAYS OF HIS THREE NIECES AND HE HAD NO DESIRE TO POSE AS A STERN GUARDIAN
1447-17506-0031 OR TO DEPRIVE HIS GIRLS OF ANY PASSING PLEASURE THEY MIGHT ENJOY MOREOVER LOUISE BEING IN LOVE WITH THAT YOUNG WELDON HER MOTHER SO STRONGLY OBJECTED TO
1447-17506-0032 SHE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO CARE MUCH FOR THIS ITALIAN FELLOW AND MISSUS MERRICK HAD ENJOINED HIM TO KEEP HER DAUGHTER'S MIND FROM DWELLING ON HER ENTANGLEMENT OH WELL MY DEAR HE SAID TO HER YOU MUST ACT AS YOU SEE FIT
1447-17506-0033 I DO NOT IMAGINE WE SHALL SEE MUCH OF THIS YOUNG MAN IN ANY EVENT AND NOW THAT YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HE IS SAILING UNDER FALSE COLORS YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM BETTER THAN I CAN ADVISE YOU
1447-17506-0034 SAID LOUISE SLOWLY AS SHE RESUMED HER WRITING WELL THEN GIRLS WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A STROLL AROUND THE VILLAGE ASKED THEIR UNCLE I'M TOLD IT'S A PROPER PLACE TO BUY SILK STOCKINGS AND INLAID WOOD WORK THEY COME ASSORTED I SUPPOSE
