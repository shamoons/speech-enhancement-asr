1455-134435-0000 THE GIRL WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD ON THAT NIGHT WHEN JESSE RAN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING TO GOD THAT HE BE GIVEN A SON HAD GROWN TO WOMANHOOD ON THE FARM
1455-134435-0001 AND WHEN NOT ANGRY SHE WAS OFTEN MOROSE AND SILENT IN WINESBURG IT WAS SAID THAT SHE DRANK HER HUSBAND THE BANKER
1455-134435-0002 BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
1455-134435-0003 SOMETIMES ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS SHE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE DISMISSING THE DRIVER SHE TOOK THE REINS IN HER OWN HANDS AND DROVE OFF AT TOP SPEED THROUGH THE STREETS
1455-134435-0004 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO RUN THEM DOWN WHEN SHE HAD DRIVEN THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS TEARING AROUND CORNERS AND BEATING THE HORSES WITH THE WHIP SHE DROVE OFF INTO THE COUNTRY ON THE COUNTRY ROADS
1455-134435-0005 SHE BECAME THOUGHTFUL AND MUTTERED WORDS SOMETIMES TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
1455-134435-0006 BUT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE RESPECT HE INSPIRED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
1455-134435-0007 HE WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO HAVE OPINIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE BUT AT TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO HAVE VERY DEFINITE OPINIONS ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS MOTHER DAVID WAS ALWAYS A QUIET ORDERLY BOY
1455-134435-0008 AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS THOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF WINESBURG TO BE SOMETHING OF A DULLARD HIS EYES WERE BROWN AND AS A CHILD HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND PEOPLE A LONG TIME WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
1455-134435-0009 WHEN HE HEARD HIS MOTHER SPOKEN OF HARSHLY OR WHEN HE OVERHEARD HER BERATING HIS FATHER HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY TO HIDE SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT FIND A HIDING PLACE AND THAT CONFUSED HIM
1455-134435-0010 HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING HE HAD A HABIT OF TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF AND EARLY IN LIFE A SPIRIT OF QUIET SADNESS OFTEN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN DAVID WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE BENTLEY FARM
1455-134435-0011 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DAVID HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GO INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER LIVED AND ON AN IMPULSE HE DECIDED TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME
1455-134435-0012 THE BOY'S IMAGINATION WAS EXCITED AND HE FANCIED THAT HE COULD SEE AND HEAR STRANGE THINGS IN THE DARKNESS INTO HIS MIND CAME THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS WALKING AND RUNNING IN SOME TERRIBLE VOID WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
1455-134435-0013 THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM SEEMED LIMITLESS THE SOUND OF THE WIND BLOWING IN TREES WAS TERRIFYING WHEN A TEAM OF HORSES APPROACHED ALONG THE ROAD IN WHICH HE WALKED HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLIMBED A FENCE THROUGH A FIELD HE RAN UNTIL HE CAME
1455-134435-0014 INTO ANOTHER ROAD AND GETTING UPON HIS KNEES FELT OF THE SOFT GROUND WITH HIS FINGERS BUT FOR THE FIGURE OF HIS GRANDFATHER WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NEVER FIND IN THE DARKNESS HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUST BE ALTOGETHER EMPTY
1455-134435-0015 WHEN HIS CRIES WERE HEARD BY A FARMER WHO WAS WALKING HOME FROM TOWN AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HE WAS SO TIRED AND EXCITED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM BY CHANCE DAVID'S FATHER KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
1455-134435-0016 ON THE STREET HE HAD MET THE FARM HAND FROM THE BENTLEY PLACE AND KNEW OF HIS SON'S RETURN TO TOWN WHEN THE BOY DID NOT COME HOME AN ALARM WAS SET UP AND JOHN HARDY WITH SEVERAL MEN OF THE TOWN WENT TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0017 THE REPORT THAT DAVID HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED RAN ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS OF WINESBURG WHEN HE CAME HOME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE BUT HIS MOTHER APPEARED AND CLUTCHED HIM EAGERLY IN HER ARMS DAVID THOUGHT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN
1455-134435-0018 FOR AN HOUR THE WOMAN SAT IN THE DARKNESS AND HELD HER BOY ALL THE TIME SHE KEPT TALKING IN A LOW VOICE DAVID COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD SO CHANGED HER HER HABITUALLY DISSATISFIED FACE HAD BECOME HE THOUGHT
1455-134435-0019 THE MOST PEACEFUL AND LOVELY THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
1455-134435-0020 ON AND ON WENT HER VOICE IT WAS NOT
1455-134435-0021 BUT SHE MADE HIM HIDE AND BE SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD SENT THEM AWAY HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GAME HIS MOTHER AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN WERE PLAYING WITH HIM AND LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
1455-134435-0022 INTO HIS MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT HIS HAVING BEEN LOST AND FRIGHTENED IN THE DARKNESS WAS AN ALTOGETHER UNIMPORTANT MATTER
1455-134435-0023 HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
1455-134435-0024 DURING THE LAST YEARS OF YOUNG DAVID'S BOYHOOD HE SAW HIS MOTHER BUT SELDOM AND SHE BECAME FOR HIM JUST A WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD ONCE LIVED STILL HE COULD NOT GET HER FIGURE OUT OF HIS MIND AND AS HE GREW OLDER IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE
1455-134435-0025 WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HE WENT TO THE BENTLEY FARM TO LIVE OLD JESSE CAME INTO TOWN AND FAIRLY DEMANDED THAT HE BE GIVEN CHARGE OF THE BOY THE OLD MAN WAS EXCITED AND DETERMINED ON HAVING HIS OWN WAY HE TALKED TO JOHN HARDY
1455-134435-0026 IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE NOT CORRUPTED BY MY PRESENCE SHE SAID SHARPLY
1455-134435-0027 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0028 EVEN WHEN THE BOY'S CLOTHES WERE PACKED AND HE WAS TAKEN AWAY SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE LOSS OF HER SON MADE A SHARP BREAK IN HER LIFE AND SHE SEEMED LESS INCLINED TO QUARREL WITH HER HUSBAND JOHN HARDY THOUGHT IT HAD ALL TURNED OUT VERY WELL INDEED
1455-134435-0029 AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
1455-134435-0030 ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOTED FOR HER FLAMING RED HAIR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WAS A BORN MOTHER AND BECAME THE BOY'S CARETAKER EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED SHE WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND SAT ON THE FLOOR
1455-134435-0031 WHEN HE BECAME DROWSY SHE BECAME BOLD AND WHISPERED THINGS THAT HE LATER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE DREAMED HER SOFT LOW VOICE CALLED HIM ENDEARING NAMES
1455-134435-0032 AND HE DREAMED THAT HIS MOTHER HAD COME TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD CHANGED SO THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS AS SHE HAD BEEN THAT TIME AFTER HE RAN AWAY HE ALSO GREW BOLD AND REACHING OUT HIS HAND STROKED THE FACE OF THE WOMAN ON THE FLOOR SO THAT SHE WAS ECSTATICALLY HAPPY
1455-134435-0033 BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
1455-134435-0034 THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO EXTEND HIS LAND HOLDINGS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE FEW FARMS IN THE VALLEY THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM BUT UNTIL DAVID CAME HE WAS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED MAN
1455-134435-0035 THERE WERE TWO INFLUENCES AT WORK IN JESSE BENTLEY AND ALL HIS LIFE HIS MIND HAD BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR THESE INFLUENCES FIRST THERE WAS THE OLD THING IN HIM HE WANTED TO BE A MAN OF GOD AND A LEADER AMONG MEN OF GOD
1455-134435-0036 HIS WALKING IN THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE FORESTS AT NIGHT HAD BROUGHT HIM CLOSE TO NATURE AND THERE WERE FORCES IN THE PASSIONATELY RELIGIOUS MAN THAT RAN OUT TO THE FORCES IN NATURE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD COME TO HIM WHEN A DAUGHTER
1455-134435-0037 BUT HE NO LONGER DEMANDED SUCH RECOGNITION INSTEAD HE PRAYED FOR IT SOMETIMES HE WAS ALTOGETHER DOUBTFUL AND THOUGHT GOD HAD DESERTED THE WORLD
1455-134435-0038 HE HAD GROWN INTO MATURITY IN AMERICA IN THE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND HE LIKE ALL MEN OF HIS TIME HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE DEEP INFLUENCES THAT WERE AT WORK IN THE COUNTRY DURING THOSE YEARS WHEN MODERN INDUSTRIALISM WAS BEING BORN
1455-134435-0039 JESSE FORMED THE HABIT OF READING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HE INVENTED A MACHINE FOR THE MAKING OF FENCE OUT OF WIRE FAINTLY HE REALIZED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF OLD TIMES AND PLACES THAT HE HAD
1455-134435-0040 ALWAYS CULTIVATED IN HIS OWN MIND WAS STRANGE AND FOREIGN TO THE THING THAT WAS GROWING UP IN THE MINDS OF OTHERS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOST MATERIALISTIC AGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHEN WARS WOULD BE FOUGHT WITHOUT PATRIOTISM WHEN MEN WOULD FORGET GOD AND
1455-134435-0041 ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO MORAL STANDARDS WHEN THE WILL TO POWER WOULD REPLACE THE WILL TO SERVE AND BEAUTY WOULD BE WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN IN THE TERRIBLE HEADLONG RUSH OF MANKIND TOWARD THE ACQUIRING OF POSSESSIONS WAS TELLING ITS STORY TO JESSE THE MAN OF GOD
1455-134435-0042 AS IT WAS TO THE MEN ABOUT HIM THE GREEDY THING IN HIM WANTED TO MAKE MONEY FASTER THAN IT COULD BE MADE BY TILLING THE LAND MORE THAN ONCE HE WENT INTO WINESBURG TO TALK WITH HIS SON IN LAW JOHN HARDY ABOUT IT YOU ARE A BANKER AND YOU WILL HAVE CHANCES I NEVER HAD
1455-134435-0043 BIG THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DONE IN THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0044 YOU GET INTO IT I WISH I WERE YOUNGER AND HAD YOUR CHANCE
1455-134435-0045 AT ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS AND HIS LEFT SIDE REMAINED SOMEWHAT WEAKENED AS HE TALKED HIS LEFT EYELID TWITCHED LATER
1455-134435-0046 AND THE STARS CAME OUT IT WAS HARDER TO GET BACK THE OLD FEELING OF A CLOSE AND PERSONAL GOD WHO LIVED IN THE SKY OVERHEAD AND WHO MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT REACH OUT HIS HAND TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER
1455-134435-0047 AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD HAD AT LAST LOOKED WITH FAVOR UPON HIM AS FOR THE BOY ON THE FARM LIFE BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM IN A THOUSAND NEW AND DELIGHTFUL WAYS THE KINDLY ATTITUDE OF ALL ABOUT HIM EXPANDED HIS QUIET NATURE
1455-134435-0048 AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
1455-134435-0049 IF SHERLEY BENTLEY THE WOMAN WHO CAME EACH NIGHT TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BY HIS BEDSIDE DID NOT APPEAR AT ONCE HE WENT TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND SHOUTED HIS YOUNG VOICE RINGING THROUGH THE NARROW HALLS WHERE FOR SO LONG THERE HAD BEEN A TRADITION OF SILENCE IN THE MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE AND LAY STILL IN BED
1455-134435-0050 THE SOUNDS THAT CAME IN TO HIM THROUGH THE WINDOWS FILLED HIM WITH DELIGHT HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF THE LIFE IN THE HOUSE IN WINESBURG AND OF HIS MOTHER'S ANGRY VOICE THAT HAD ALWAYS MADE HIM TREMBLE THERE IN THE COUNTRY ALL SOUNDS WERE PLEASANT SOUNDS
1455-134435-0051 WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
1455-134435-0052 BY THE CATTLE IN THE STABLES AND ONE OF THE FARM HANDS SPOKE SHARPLY TO THE HORSE HE WAS GROOMING BY THE STABLE DOOR DAVID LEAPED OUT OF BED AND RAN TO A WINDOW ALL OF THE PEOPLE STIRRING ABOUT EXCITED HIS MIND AND HE WONDERED WHAT HIS MOTHER WAS DOING
1455-134435-0053 SIX SEVEN HE SAID SLOWLY WETTING HIS FINGER AND MAKING STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN MARKS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE DAVID RAN TO PUT ON HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT A FEVERISH DESIRE TO GET OUT OF DOORS TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0054 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0055 HENRY STRADER AN OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN ON THE FARM SINCE JESSE CAME INTO POSSESSION AND WHO BEFORE DAVID'S TIME HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE A JOKE MADE THE SAME JOKE EVERY MORNING IT AMUSED DAVID SO THAT HE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS
1455-134435-0056 THEY RODE IN A COMFORTABLE OLD PHAETON DRAWN BY THE WHITE HORSE THE OLD MAN SCRATCHED HIS THIN WHITE BEARD AND TALKED TO HIMSELF OF HIS PLANS FOR INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE FIELDS THEY VISITED AND OF GOD'S PART IN THE PLANS ALL MEN MADE
1455-134435-0057 SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT DAVID AND SMILED HAPPILY AND THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE APPEARED TO FORGET THE BOY'S EXISTENCE
1455-134435-0058 WHEN HE HAD FIRST COME OUT OF THE CITY TO LIVE ON THE LAND
1455-134435-0059 JESSE AND HIS GRANDSON WERE DRIVING IN A DISTANT PART OF THE VALLEY SOME MILES FROM HOME A FOREST CAME DOWN TO THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE FOREST WINE CREEK WRIGGLED ITS WAY OVER STONES TOWARD A DISTANT RIVER
1455-134435-0060 ALL THE AFTERNOON JESSE HAD BEEN IN A MEDITATIVE MOOD AND NOW HE BEGAN TO TALK HIS MIND WENT BACK TO THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THOUGHTS OF A GIANT THAT MIGHT COME TO ROB AND PLUNDER HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
1455-134435-0061 AND AGAIN AS ON THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING FOR A SON HE BECAME EXCITED TO THE EDGE OF INSANITY
1455-134435-0062 WHEN A RABBIT JUMPED UP AND RAN AWAY THROUGH THE WOODS HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND DANCED WITH DELIGHT
1455-134435-0063 JESSE BENTLEY WENT ALONG UNDER THE TREES WITH HIS HEAD BOWED AND WITH HIS MIND IN A FERMENT HIS EARNESTNESS AFFECTED THE BOY WHO PRESENTLY BECAME SILENT AND A LITTLE ALARMED
1455-134435-0064 THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE BOY AND MAN ON THEIR KNEES IN SOME LONELY SPOT IN THE FOREST WOULD MAKE THE MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST INEVITABLE
1455-134435-0065 IT WAS IN JUST SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT OTHER DAVID TENDED THE SHEEP WHEN HIS FATHER CAME AND TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN UNTO SAUL HE MUTTERED
1455-134435-0066 HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
1455-134435-0067 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE NOT ONLY OF HIS GRANDFATHER BUT OF SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HURT HIM SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT KINDLY BUT DANGEROUS AND BRUTAL
1455-134435-0068 WHEN JESSE BENTLEY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN IDEA SUDDENLY AROSE AND ADVANCED TOWARD HIM HIS TERROR GREW UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY SHOOK IN THE WOODS AN INTENSE SILENCE SEEMED TO LIE OVER EVERYTHING AND SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SILENCE CAME THE OLD MAN'S HARSH AND INSISTENT VOICE
1455-134435-0069 GRIPPING THE BOY'S SHOULDERS JESSE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE SKY AND SHOUTED THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED AND HIS HAND ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER TWITCHED ALSO MAKE A SIGN TO ME GOD HE CRIED HERE I STAND WITH THE BOY DAVID
1455-134435-0070 COME DOWN TO ME OUT OF THE SKY AND MAKE THY PRESENCE KNOWN TO ME WITH A CRY OF FEAR DAVID TURNED AND SHAKING HIMSELF LOOSE FROM THE HANDS THAT HELD HIM RAN AWAY THROUGH THE FOREST
1455-134435-0071 THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0072 ON AND ON HE RAN DOWN THE HILLSIDE SOBBING AS HE RAN WHEN HE FELL OVER THE ROOTS OF A TREE AND IN FALLING STRUCK HIS HEAD
1455-134435-0073 AND HE AWOKE TO FIND THE OLD MAN'S HAND STROKING HIS HEAD TENDERLY THAT THE TERROR LEFT HIM
