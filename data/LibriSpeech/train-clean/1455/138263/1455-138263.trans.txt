1455-138263-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0002 SOME TWELVE MILES OTHERS THIRTY MILES BROAD
1455-138263-0003 AND SEEMED TO COVER PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE EAST THE NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ONE OF THESE JETS EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCLE OF NEANDER SITUATED ON THE FORTIETH MERIDIAN
1455-138263-0004 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0005 WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
1455-138263-0006 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0008 BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
1455-138263-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0010 WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
1455-138263-0011 THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
1455-138263-0012 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0013 THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0014 THEIR PROJECTILE SATURATED WITH LUMINOUS GLEAMS IN THE DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF SUN AND MOON MUST HAVE APPEARED LIKE AN INCANDESCENT GLOBE
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0017 I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0018 HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
1455-138263-0019 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0020 IN HER ACTUAL STATE WITH HER SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE CERTAINLY VERY MUCH REDUCED HER SEAS FOR THE MOST PART DRIED UP HER INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF WATER RESTRICTED VEGETATION SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS OF COLD AND HEAT
1455-138263-0021 HER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS THE MOON DOES NOT SEEM HABITABLE TO ME NOR DOES SHE SEEM PROPITIOUS TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT NOR SUFFICIENT FOR THE WANTS OF EXISTENCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
1455-138263-0022 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0023 SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
1455-138263-0024 AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS THE GEOLOGICAL WORKS OF NATURE NEVER THE WORK OF MAN IF THEN THERE EXIST REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ON THE MOON
1455-138263-0025 THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
1455-138263-0026 THESE TRACES ARE NOWHERE VISIBLE THERE REMAINS BUT ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT OF A LIVING RACE TO WHICH MOTION WHICH IS LIFE IS FOREIGN ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY LIVING CREATURES WHICH DO NOT LIVE REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0027 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0028 SAID NICHOLL LET US ATTACK THE SECOND QUESTION AN INDISPENSABLE COMPLEMENT OF THE FIRST I ASK THE HONORABLE COMMISSION IF THE MOON IS NOT HABITABLE HAS SHE EVER BEEN INHABITED CITIZEN BARBICANE
1455-138263-0029 MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
1455-138263-0030 I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
1455-138263-0031 BUT I ADD THAT THESE RACES HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND ARE NOW FOREVER EXTINCT
1455-138263-0032 RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
1455-138263-0033 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0034 CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
1455-138263-0035 FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0037 VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
1455-138263-0038 LIGHT LIKE HEAT CAN DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE AIR HENCE AN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE INFLUENCES WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS NOW THAT ATMOSPHERE HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND NOW I AM GOING TO ASTONISH YOU
1455-138263-0039 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0040 ASKED NICHOLL QUICKLY BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY THEN THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE MOON UPON HER AXIS WAS NOT EQUAL TO HER REVOLUTION AN EQUALITY WHICH PRESENTS EACH PART OF HER DISC DURING FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE ACTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS
1455-138263-0041 GRANTED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT WHY SHOULD NOT THESE TWO MOTIONS HAVE BEEN EQUAL AS THEY ARE REALLY SO BECAUSE THAT EQUALITY HAS ONLY BEEN DETERMINED BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION
1455-138263-0042 AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0044 THOSE SPECULATIONS ARE TOO HIGH SAID HE PROBLEMS UTTERLY INSOLUBLE
1455-138263-0045 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0046 BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0047 AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
1455-138263-0048 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0050 PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
1455-138263-0051 AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
1455-138263-0052 BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
1455-138263-0053 BE BROUGHT DOWN TO ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS EXCLAIMED MICHEL AH I BREATHE AGAIN REALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED TO HEAR YOU I IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TO LIVE
1455-138263-0054 BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
1455-138263-0055 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1455-138263-0056 THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
