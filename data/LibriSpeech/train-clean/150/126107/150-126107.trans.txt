150-126107-0000 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0001 WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
150-126107-0002 BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
150-126107-0003 HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
150-126107-0004 OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
150-126107-0005 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0007 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0008 AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
150-126107-0009 SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
150-126107-0010 FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
150-126107-0011 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0013 SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0016 UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
150-126107-0017 WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
150-126107-0018 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0019 THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
150-126107-0020 FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
150-126107-0021 NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
150-126107-0022 ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
150-126107-0023 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0024 VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
150-126107-0025 IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
150-126107-0027 DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
150-126107-0028 TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
150-126107-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
150-126107-0030 AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126107-0031 AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
150-126107-0032 THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
150-126107-0033 AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
150-126107-0034 WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0037 HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
150-126107-0038 AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
150-126107-0039 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126107-0040 AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
