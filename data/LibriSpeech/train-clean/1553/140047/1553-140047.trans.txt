1553-140047-0000 SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
1553-140047-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN BORN AND REARED IN A STATE OF ADVENTUROUS POVERTY AND PERILOUS UNCERTAINTY RIVERBORO WAS DOING ITS BEST TO RETURN THE ENTIRE TRIBE OF SIMPSONS TO THE LAND OF ITS FATHERS SO TO SPEAK
1553-140047-0002 THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1553-140047-0003 AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
1553-140047-0004 THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY POPULAR FAVORITES BUT THEY DID RECEIVE CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE MORSELS FROM THE MORE CHARITABLE HOUSEWIVES LIFE WAS RATHER DULL AND DREARY HOWEVER AND IN THE CHILL AND GLOOM OF NOVEMBER WEATHER
1553-140047-0005 WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
1553-140047-0006 AND SETTLED UPON THE SELLING OF SOAP FOR A PREMIUM THEY HAD SOLD ENOUGH TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DURING THE EARLIER AUTUMN TO SECURE A CHILD'S HANDCART WHICH THOUGH VERY WEAK ON ITS PINS COULD BE TRUNDLED OVER THE COUNTRY ROADS
1553-140047-0007 WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
1553-140047-0008 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0009 WITH HIGHLY COLORED PICTURES OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE AWARDED FOR THE SALE OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAKES IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLARA BELLE AND SUSAN SIMPSON CONSULTED REBECCA WHO THREW HERSELF SOLIDLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE ENTERPRISE
1553-140047-0010 PROMISING HER HELP AND THAT OF EMMA JANE PERKINS THE PREMIUMS WITHIN THEIR POSSIBLE GRASP WERE THREE A BOOKCASE A PLUSH RECLINING CHAIR AND A BANQUET LAMP OF COURSE THE SIMPSONS HAD NO BOOKS
1553-140047-0011 AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
1553-140047-0012 NOT COUNTING MISTER SIMPSON WHO ORDINARILY SAT ELSEWHERE AT THE TOWN'S EXPENSE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES RAPTUROUSLY IN THE VISION OF THE BANQUET LAMP WHICH SPEEDILY BECAME TO THEM MORE DESIRABLE THAN FOOD DRINK OR CLOTHING
1553-140047-0013 NEITHER EMMA JANE NOR REBECCA PERCEIVED ANYTHING INCONGRUOUS IN THE IDEA OF THE SIMPSONS STRIVING FOR A BANQUET LAMP THEY LOOKED AT THE PICTURE DAILY AND KNEW THAT IF THEY THEMSELVES WERE FREE AGENTS THEY WOULD TOIL SUFFER
1553-140047-0014 AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
1553-140047-0015 BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0016 THOUGH IT WAS INVARIABLY MISTAKEN FOR SOLID GOLD AND THE SHADE THAT ACCOMPANIED IT AT LEAST IT ACCOMPANIED IT IF THE AGENT SOLD A HUNDRED EXTRA CAKES WAS OF CRINKLED CREPE PAPER PRINTED IN A DOZEN DELICIOUS HUES
1553-140047-0017 FROM WHICH THE JOY DAZZLED AGENT MIGHT TAKE HIS CHOICE SEESAW SIMPSON WAS NOT IN THE SYNDICATE CLARA BELLE WAS RATHER A SUCCESSFUL AGENT BUT SUSAN WHO COULD ONLY SAY THOAP NEVER MADE LARGE RETURNS
1553-140047-0018 AND THE TWINS WHO WERE SOMEWHAT YOUNG TO BE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY COULD BE GIVEN ONLY A HALF DOZEN CAKES AT A TIME AND WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR BUSINESS TRIPS A BRIEF DOCUMENT STATING THE PRICE PER CAKE DOZEN AND BOX
1553-140047-0019 REBECCA AND EMMA JANE OFFERED TO GO TWO OR THREE MILES IN SOME ONE DIRECTION AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO IN THE WAY OF STIRRING UP A POPULAR DEMAND FOR THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED BRANDS THE FORMER BEING DEVOTED TO LAUNDRY PURPOSES
1553-140047-0020 AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
1553-140047-0021 AND THEY HAD WHAT WAS STILL BETTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF A CERTAIN PATENT MEDICINE VENDER'S DISCOURSE AT THE MILLTOWN FAIR HIS METHOD WHEN ONCE OBSERVED COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR HIS MANNER NOR HIS VOCABULARY
1553-140047-0022 EMMA JANE PRACTICED IT ON REBECCA AND REBECCA ON EMMA JANE CAN I SELL YOU A LITTLE SOAP THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CALLED THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED SOAP
1553-140047-0023 SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
1553-140047-0024 OH REBECCA DON'T LET'S SAY THAT INTERPOSED EMMA JANE HYSTERICALLY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FOOL IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL EMMA JANE REBUKED REBECCA THAT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE ONE
1553-140047-0025 I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
1553-140047-0026 IMMERSE THE GARMENTS IN A TUB LIGHTLY RUBBING THE MORE SOILED PORTIONS WITH THE SOAP LEAVE THEM SUBMERGED IN WATER FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE AND THEN THE YOUNGEST BABY CAN WASH THEM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
1553-140047-0027 BABE NOT BABY CORRECTED REBECCA FROM THE CIRCULAR IT'S JUST THE SAME THING ARGUED EMMA JANE OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE SAME THING BUT A BABY HAS GOT TO BE CALLED BABE OR INFANT IN A CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0028 THE SAME AS IT IS IN POETRY WOULD YOU RATHER SAY INFANT NO GRUMBLED EMMA JANE INFANT IS WORSE EVEN THAN BABE
1553-140047-0029 AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
1553-140047-0030 OH WON'T IT BE THE GREATEST FUN EMMA JANE AT SOME OF THE HOUSES WHERE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ME I SHAN'T BE FRIGHTENED AND I SHALL REEL OFF THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE INVALID BABE AND ALL
1553-140047-0031 PERHAPS I SHALL SAY EVEN THE LAST SENTENCE IF I CAN REMEMBER IT WE SOUND EVERY CHORD IN THE GREAT MAC RO COSM OF SATISFACTION
1553-140047-0032 THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
1553-140047-0033 SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
1553-140047-0034 WHEN THE CHILDREN ASKED MISSUS PERKINS IF THEY COULD CALL AT JUST A FEW HOUSES COMING AND GOING AND SELL A LITTLE SOAP FOR THE SIMPSONS SHE AT FIRST REPLIED DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE
1553-140047-0035 SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
1553-140047-0036 BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
1553-140047-0037 THESE WERE LIFTED INTO THE BACK OF THE WAGON AND A HAPPIER COUPLE NEVER DROVE ALONG THE COUNTRY ROAD THAN REBECCA AND HER COMPANION IT WAS A GLORIOUS INDIAN SUMMER DAY WHICH SUGGESTED NOTHING OF THANKSGIVING NEAR AT HAND AS IT WAS
1553-140047-0038 IT WAS A RUSTLY DAY A SCARLET AND BUFF YELLOW AND CARMINE BRONZE AND CRIMSON DAY THERE WERE STILL MANY LEAVES ON THE OAKS AND MAPLES MAKING A GOODLY SHOW OF RED AND BROWN AND GOLD
1553-140047-0039 THE AIR WAS LIKE SPARKLING CIDER AND EVERY FIELD HAD ITS HEAPS OF YELLOW AND RUSSET GOOD THINGS TO EAT ALL READY FOR THE BARNS THE MILLS AND THE MARKETS THE HORSE FORGOT HIS TWENTY YEARS
1553-140047-0040 SNIFFED THE SWEET BRIGHT AIR AND TROTTED LIKE A COLT NOKOMIS MOUNTAIN LOOKED BLUE AND CLEAR IN THE DISTANCE REBECCA STOOD IN THE WAGON AND APOSTROPHIZED THE LANDSCAPE WITH SUDDEN JOY OF LIVING
1553-140047-0041 GREAT WIDE BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WORLD WITH THE WONDERFUL WATER ROUND YOU CURLED AND THE WONDERFUL GRASS UPON YOUR BREAST WORLD YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DREST
1553-140047-0042 DULL EMMA JANE HAD NEVER SEEMED TO REBECCA SO NEAR SO DEAR SO TRIED AND TRUE AND REBECCA TO EMMA JANE'S FAITHFUL HEART HAD NEVER BEEN SO BRILLIANT SO BEWILDERING SO FASCINATING AS IN THIS VISIT TOGETHER
1553-140047-0043 WITH ITS INTIMACY ITS FREEDOM AND THE ADDED DELIGHTS OF AN EXCITING BUSINESS ENTERPRISE A GORGEOUS LEAF BLEW INTO THE WAGON DOES COLOR MAKE YOU SORT OF DIZZY ASKED REBECCA
1553-140047-0044 NO IT DON'T NOT A MITE PERHAPS DIZZY ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT'S NEAREST I'D LIKE TO EAT COLOR AND DRINK IT AND SLEEP IN IT IF YOU COULD BE A TREE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
1553-140047-0045 EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
1553-140047-0046 I'D RATHER BE AN APPLE TREE IN BLOSSOM THAT ONE THAT BLOOMS PINK BY OUR PIG PEN REBECCA LAUGHED THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IN EMMA JANE'S REPLIES
1553-140047-0047 I'D CHOOSE TO BE THAT SCARLET MAPLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE POND THERE AND SHE POINTED WITH THE WHIP THEN I COULD SEE SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR PINK APPLE TREE BY THE PIG PEN I COULD LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
1553-140047-0048 SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF
1553-140047-0049 THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE A BROWN SASH LIKE THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHERE COULD I BE GREEN DO THEY HAVE GREEN PETTICOATS I WONDER I'D LIKE A GREEN PETTICOAT COMING OUT NOW AND THEN UNDERNEATH
1553-140047-0050 TO SHOW WHAT MY LEAVES WERE LIKE BEFORE I WAS A SCARLET MAPLE I THINK IT WOULD BE AWFUL HOMELY SAID EMMA JANE
1553-140047-0051 WITH A PINK SASH PINK STOCKINGS BRONZE SLIPPERS
