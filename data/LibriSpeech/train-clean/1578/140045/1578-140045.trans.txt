1578-140045-0000 THE STIRRING OF THE POWERS REBECCA'S VISIT TO MILLTOWN WAS ALL THAT HER GLOWING FANCY HAD PAINTED IT EXCEPT THAT RECENT READINGS ABOUT ROME AND VENICE DISPOSED HER TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE CITIES MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER MILLTOWN
1578-140045-0001 IN THE MATTER OF MERE PICTORIAL BEAUTY SO SOON DOES THE SOUL OUTGROW ITS MANSIONS THAT AFTER ONCE SEEING MILLTOWN HER FANCY RAN OUT TO THE FUTURE SIGHT OF PORTLAND FOR THAT HAVING ISLANDS AND A HARBOR AND TWO PUBLIC MONUMENTS
1578-140045-0002 MUST BE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MILLTOWN WHICH WOULD SHE FELT TAKE ITS PROUD PLACE AMONG THE CITIES OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ITS TREMENDOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BY ANY IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION
1578-140045-0003 I TELL YOU HARRIET BEECHER STOWE HERSELF COULDN'T A DONE IT BETTER JUSTICE I TOOK IT ALL IN RESPONDED MISTER COBB WHO WAS PLEASED THAT MOTHER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT REBECCA I AIN'T SURE BUT SHE'S GOIN TO TURN OUT SOMETHIN REMARKABLE
1578-140045-0004 LAND NO MOTHER THERE AIN'T NO HOME'PATH BOUT MISS PARKS SHE DRIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I CAN'T SEE REBECCA AS A LADY DOCTOR SOMEHOW MUSED MISSUS COBB HER GIFT O GAB IS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THE MAKIN OF HER
1578-140045-0005 OR RECITE PIECES LIKE THAT PORTLAND ELOCUTIONIST THAT COME OUT HERE TO THE HARVEST SUPPER I GUESS SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WRITE DOWN HER OWN PIECES SAID MISTER COBB CONFIDENTLY SHE COULD MAKE EM UP FASTER N SHE COULD READ EM OUT OF A BOOK
1578-140045-0006 REBECCA MADE A POOR HAND AT COMPOSITION WRITING AT THIS TIME MISS DEARBORN GAVE HER EVERY SORT OF SUBJECT THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN HERSELF CLOUD PICTURES ABRAHAM LINCOLN NATURE PHILANTHROPY SLAVERY INTEMPERANCE JOY AND DUTY
1578-140045-0007 SOLITUDE BUT WITH NONE OF THEM DID REBECCA SEEM TO GRAPPLE SATISFACTORILY WRITE AS YOU TALK REBECCA INSISTED POOR MISS DEARBORN WHO SECRETLY KNEW THAT SHE COULD NEVER MANAGE A GOOD COMPOSITION HERSELF
1578-140045-0008 NOW IN YOUR LAST ONE ON SOLITUDE YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING AND YOU'VE MADE IT TOO COMMON AND EVERY DAY TO SOUND WELL THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUS AND YOURS IN IT YOU OUGHT TO SAY ONE NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE LIKE GOOD WRITING ONE OPENS A FAVORITE BOOK
1578-140045-0009 ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE A GREAT COMFORT IN SOLITUDE AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT SOLITUDE THIS WEEK THAN I DID ABOUT JOY AND DUTY LAST WEEK GRUMBLED REBECCA YOU TRIED TO BE FUNNY ABOUT JOY AND DUTY SAID MISS DEARBORN REPROVINGLY SO OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED
1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140045-0011 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS SHE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YOU HAVE AT LEAST TWO LINES REBECCA INSISTED THE TEACHER FOR I SEE THEM ON YOUR SLATE
1578-140045-0012 READ WHAT YOU HAVE GOOD OR BAD LITTLE OR MUCH I AM EXCUSING NOBODY REBECCA ROSE OVERCOME WITH SECRET LAUGHTER DREAD AND MORTIFICATION THEN IN A LOW VOICE SHE READ THE COUPLET
1578-140045-0013 AND THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG IDEA SELDOM APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MUST STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND TRY AGAIN REBECCA SHE SAID BUT SHE SAID IT SMILINGLY YOUR POETRY HASN'T A VERY NICE IDEA IN IT FOR A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO LOVE DUTY
1578-140045-0014 IT WASN'T MY IDEA SAID REBECCA APOLOGETICALLY I HAD ONLY MADE THE FIRST LINE WHEN I SAW YOU WERE GOING TO RING THE BELL AND SAY THE TIME WAS UP I HAD CLASH WRITTEN AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THEN BUT HASH OR RASH OR SMASH I'LL CHANGE IT TO THIS
1578-140045-0015 HAVING BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN ONE AS GIVING A REFINED AND ELEGANT TOUCH TO LITERARY EFFORTS REBECCA PAINSTAKINGLY REWROTE HER COMPOSITION ON SOLITUDE GIVING IT ALL THE BENEFIT OF MISS DEARBORN'S SUGGESTION
1578-140045-0016 IT THEN APPEARED IN THE FOLLOWING FORM WHICH HARDLY SATISFIED EITHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SOLITUDE IT WOULD BE FALSE TO SAY THAT ONE COULD EVER BE ALONE WHEN ONE HAS ONE'S LOVELY THOUGHTS TO COMFORT ONE
1578-140045-0017 ONE SITS BY ONE'S SELF IT IS TRUE BUT ONE THINKS ONE OPENS ONE'S FAVORITE BOOK AND READS ONE'S FAVORITE STORY ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S AUNT OR ONE'S BROTHER FONDLES ONE'S CAT
1578-140045-0018 DOES ONE EVER FEEL BEREFT WHEN ONE PICKS UP ONE'S CHIPS TO LIGHT ONE'S FIRE FOR ONE'S EVENING MEAL OR WHEN ONE WASHES ONE'S MILK PAIL BEFORE MILKING ONE'S COW ONE WOULD FANCY NOT R R R
1578-140045-0019 DON'T YOU THINK CALLING SUPPER ONE'S EVENING MEAL IS PRETTY AND ISN'T BEREFT A NICE WORD YES THAT PART OF IT DOES VERY WELL IT IS THE CAT THE CHIPS AND THE MILK PAIL THAT I DON'T LIKE
1578-140045-0020 YES I DON'T LIKE A COW IN A COMPOSITION SAID THE DIFFICULT MISS DEARBORN
1578-140045-0021 FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
1578-140045-0022 DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
1578-140045-0023 EMMA JANE LIVING AND I WERE WALKING ALONG AND I WAS AHEAD I SAW THE WATER STREAMING OVER THE ROAD TOWARDS THE DITCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN AT MILLTOWN WHEN ELIZA TOOK HER BABY AND RAN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE ICE BLOCKS PURSUED BY THE BLOODHOUNDS
1578-140045-0024 WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
1578-140045-0025 AND PART OF THE TIME SHE HAD TO PURSUE THE DOG I KNEW LIVING WOULD REMEMBER TOO SO I TOOK OFF MY WATERPROOF AND WRAPPED IT ROUND MY BOOKS FOR A BABY
1578-140045-0026 JUST LIKE THAT THE SAME AS ELIZA DID IN THE PLAY THEN I LEAPED FROM PUDDLE TO PUDDLE AND LIVING AND EMMA JANE PURSUED ME LIKE THE BLOODHOUNDS IT'S JUST LIKE THAT STUPID MINNIE SMELLIE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A GAME WHEN SHE SEES ONE AND ELIZA WASN'T SWEARING WHEN SHE SAID MY GOD THE RIVER
1578-140045-0027 IT WAS MORE LIKE PRAYING WELL YOU'VE GOT NO CALL TO BE PRAYIN ANY MORE THAN SWEARIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SAID MIRANDA BUT I'M THANKFUL IT'S NO WORSE YOU'RE BORN TO TROUBLE AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD
1578-140045-0028 AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
1578-140045-0029 BUT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I CAN'T HARDLY TELL TILL SHE GROWS UP SHE'S GOT THE MAKING OF MOST ANYTHING IN HER REBECCA HAS BUT I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF WE WERE NOT FITTED TO COPE WITH HER STUFF AN NONSENSE SAID MIRANDA
