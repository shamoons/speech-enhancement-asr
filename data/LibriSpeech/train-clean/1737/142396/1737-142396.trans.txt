1737-142396-0000 I CAN SEE NOW THAT TO CHILDREN WITH A PROPER EQUIPMENT OF PARENTS THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE WORN A DIFFERENT ASPECT BUT TO THOSE WHOSE NEAREST WERE AUNTS AND UNCLES A SPECIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND MAY BE ALLOWED THEY TREATED US INDEED WITH KINDNESS ENOUGH AS TO THE NEEDS OF THE FLESH
1737-142396-0001 WHILE THERE GREW UP IN ME AS IN THE PARALLEL CASE OF CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS A VAGUE SENSE OF A RULING POWER WILFUL AND FREAKISH AND PRONE TO THE PRACTICE OF VAGARIES JUST CHOOSING SO
1737-142396-0002 BUT ONLY A CERTAIN BLEND OF ENVY OF THEIR GOOD LUCK AND PITY FOR THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF IT INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS FEATURES IN THEIR CHARACTER WHEN WE TROUBLED OURSELVES TO WASTE A THOUGHT ON THEM WHICH WASN'T OFTEN
1737-142396-0003 THEY WERE FREE TO ISSUE FORTH AND BUY GUNPOWDER IN THE FULL EYE OF THE SUN FREE TO FIRE CANNONS AND EXPLODE MINES ON THE LAWN YET THEY NEVER DID ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS NO IRRESISTIBLE ENERGY HALED THEM TO CHURCH O SUNDAYS
1737-142396-0004 YET THEY WENT THERE REGULARLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOUGH THEY BETRAYED NO GREATER DELIGHT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAN OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE OLYMPIANS SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY VOID OF INTERESTS
1737-142396-0005 EVEN AS THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE CONFINED AND SLOW AND THEIR HABITS STEREOTYPED AND SENSELESS TO ANYTHING BUT APPEARANCES THEY WERE BLIND
1737-142396-0006 A PLACE ELF HAUNTED WONDERFUL SIMPLY PRODUCED SO MANY APPLES AND CHERRIES OR IT DIDN'T WHEN THE FAILURES OF NATURE WERE NOT INFREQUENTLY ASCRIBED TO US
1737-142396-0007 THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
1737-142396-0008 THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CURATE WHO WOULD RECEIVE UNBLENCHING THE INFORMATION THAT THE MEADOW BEYOND THE ORCHARD WAS A PRAIRIE STUDDED WITH HERDS OF BUFFALO WHICH IT WAS OUR DELIGHT MOCCASINED AND TOMAHAWKED TO RIDE DOWN WITH THOSE WHOOPS THAT ANNOUNCE THE SCENTING OF BLOOD
1737-142396-0009 HE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SNEERED AS THE OLYMPIANS WOULD HAVE DONE BUT POSSESSED OF A SERIOUS IDIOSYNCRASY HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH LOTS OF VALUABLE SUGGESTION
1737-142396-0010 THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
1737-142396-0011 I TRUST HE IS A BISHOP BY THIS TIME HE HAD ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS AS WE KNEW THESE STRANGE FOLK HAD VISITORS SOMETIMES STIFF AND COLOURLESS OLYMPIANS LIKE THEMSELVES EQUALLY WITHOUT VITAL INTERESTS AND INTELLIGENT PURSUITS
1737-142396-0012 EMERGING OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND PASSING AWAY AGAIN TO DRAG ON AN AIMLESS EXISTENCE SOMEWHERE OUT OF OUR KEN THEN BRUTE FORCE WAS PITILESSLY APPLIED WE WERE CAPTURED WASHED AND FORCED INTO CLEAN COLLARS
1737-142396-0013 SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN
1737-142396-0014 HOW COULD REASONABLE PEOPLE SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS TIME SO
1737-142396-0015 OR TO HUNT BEARS AMONG THE HAZELS IT WAS INCESSANT MATTER FOR AMAZEMENT HOW THESE OLYMPIANS WOULD TALK OVER OUR HEADS DURING MEALS FOR INSTANCE OF THIS OR THE OTHER SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INANITY
1737-142396-0016 UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
1737-142396-0017 WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
1737-142396-0018 THAN THE KINDLY BEASTS WHO SHARED OUR NATURAL EXISTENCE IN THE SUN THE ESTRANGEMENT WAS FORTIFIED BY AN ABIDING SENSE OF INJUSTICE
1737-142396-0019 OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
1737-142396-0020 BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
1737-142396-0021 THERE WAS NO HANDSOME EXPRESSION OF REGRET ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE REAL CULPRIT WHAT HAROLD HAD FELT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE IMPRISONMENT INDEED HE HAD VERY SOON ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW WITH ASSISTANCE FROM HIS ALLIES AND HAD ONLY GONE BACK IN TIME FOR HIS RELEASE AS THE OLYMPIAN HABIT
1737-142396-0022 WELL THE OLYMPIANS ARE ALL PAST AND GONE SOMEHOW THE SUN DOES NOT SEEM TO SHINE SO BRIGHTLY AS IT USED THE TRACKLESS MEADOWS OF OLD TIME HAVE SHRUNK AND DWINDLED AWAY TO A FEW POOR ACRES
1737-142396-0023 A SADDENING DOUBT A DULL SUSPICION CREEPS OVER ME ET IN ARCADIA EGO
