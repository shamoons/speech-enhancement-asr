1737-142397-0001 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
1737-142397-0002 SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
1737-142397-0003 THE VARIOUS OUTDOOR JOYS OF PUDDLES AND SUN AND HEDGE BREAKING FOR ALL COLT LIKE I RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS FRISKING HAPPY HEELS IN THE FACE OF NATURE LAUGHING RESPONSIVE ABOVE THE SKY WAS BLUEST OF THE BLUE WIDE POOLS LEFT BY THE WINTER'S FLOODS
1737-142397-0004 FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
1737-142397-0005 OH HE'S JUST PLAYIN MUFFIN MAN AS USUAL SAID CHARLOTTE WITH PETULANCE FANCY WANTING TO BE A MUFFIN MAN ON A WHOLE HOLIDAY IT WAS A STRANGE CRAZE CERTAINLY BUT HAROLD WHO INVENTED HIS OWN GAMES AND PLAYED THEM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
1737-142397-0006 ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
1737-142397-0007 AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
1737-142397-0008 TO PASS ALONG BUSY STREETS OF YOUR OWN BUILDING FOR EVER RINGING AN IMAGINARY BELL AND OFFERING AIRY MUFFINS OF YOUR OWN MAKE TO A BUSTLING THRONGING CROWD OF YOUR OWN CREATION THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THE GAME IT CANNOT BE DENIED THOUGH IT SEEMED SCARCE IN HARMONY WITH THIS RADIANT WIND SWEPT MORNING
1737-142397-0009 ONLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY I TOLD YOU COS IT'S TO BE A SURPRISE ALL RIGHT I SAID MAGNANIMOUSLY
1737-142397-0010 BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
1737-142397-0011 AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
1737-142397-0012 DO SHOUTED EDWARD VALIANTLY I SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD
1737-142397-0013 HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED

1737-142397-0015 NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
1737-142397-0016 AT EACH STEP GROWING LESS CHARLOTTE THE MUMMER OF A MINUTE AND MORE THE ANXIOUS PILGRIM OF ALL TIME THE LION'S WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE AT HER APPROACH HIS ROARING FILLED THE STARTLED AIR
1737-142397-0017 INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
1737-142397-0018 BUT THE PASSION AND THE CALL OF THE DIVINE MORNING WERE HIGH IN MY BLOOD EARTH TO EARTH THAT WAS THE FRANK NOTE THE JOYOUS SUMMONS OF THE DAY AND THEY COULD NOT BUT JAR AND SEEM ARTIFICIAL THESE HUMAN DISCUSSIONS AND PRETENCES
1737-142397-0019 THE PANT AND SMOKE OF A DISTANT TRAIN ALL WERE WINE OR SONG WAS IT OR ODOUR THIS UNITY THEY ALL BLENDED INTO I HAD NO WORDS THEN TO DESCRIBE IT THAT EARTH EFFLUENCE OF WHICH I WAS SO CONSCIOUS NOR INDEED HAVE I FOUND WORDS SINCE
1737-142397-0020 I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
1737-142397-0021 A WEARY UNRHYTHMIC THING OF RISE AND FALL AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE UTTERANCE AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE THING FITTING AND RIGHT AND PERFECT HUMANITY WOULD HAVE REJECTED IT WITH SCORN NATURE EVERYWHERE SINGING IN THE SAME KEY
1737-142397-0022 RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
1737-142397-0023 A BELATED TRUANT YOU HAVE DRAGGED A WEARY FOOT HOMEWARD WITH ONLY A PALE EXPRESSIONLESS MOON FOR COMPANY TO DAY WHY NOT I THE TRICKSTER THE HYPOCRITE I WHO WHIP ROUND CORNERS AND BLUSTER RELAPSE AND EVADE THEN RALLY AND PURSUE
1737-142397-0024 I CAN LEAD YOU THE BEST AND RAREST DANCE OF ANY FOR I AM THE STRONG CAPRICIOUS ONE THE LORD OF MISRULE AND I ALONE AM IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNPRINCIPLED AND OBEY NO LAW AND FOR ME I WAS READY ENOUGH TO FALL IN WITH THE FELLOW'S HUMOUR WAS NOT THIS A WHOLE HOLIDAY
1737-142397-0025 SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
1737-142397-0026 SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
1737-142397-0027 WITH SALIENT INTERESTS AND ACTIVE PURSUITS BECKONING THEM ON FROM EVERY SIDE COULD THUS
1737-142397-0028 AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
1737-142397-0029 AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
1737-142397-0030 BILL'S COVETED BOOTY TOO I COULD EASILY GUESS AT THAT IT CAME FROM THE VICAR'S STORE OF BISCUITS KEPT AS I KNEW
1737-142397-0031 THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
1737-142397-0032 AND I FELT SURE AS I RAMBLED OFF IN HIS WAKE THAT HE HAD MORE HOLIDAY MATTER TO SHOW ME AND SO INDEED HE HAD AND ALL OF IT WAS TO THE SAME LAWLESS TUNE LIKE A BLACK PIRATE FLAG ON THE BLUE OCEAN OF AIR A HAWK HUNG OMINOUS THEN PLUMMET WISE DROPPED TO THE HEDGEROW
1737-142397-0033 WHENCE THERE ROSE THIN AND SHRILL A PITEOUS VOICE OF SQUEALING BY THE TIME I GOT THERE A WHISK OF FEATHERS ON THE TURF LIKE SCATTERED PLAYBILLS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO TELL OF THE TRAGEDY JUST ENACTED YET NATURE SMILED AND SANG ON PITILESS GAY IMPARTIAL
1737-142397-0034 TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
1737-142397-0035 A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1737-142397-0036 JUBILANT AS EVER HER SONG WENT BUBBLING ON AND DEATH IN LIFE AND AGAIN LIFE IN DEATH WERE ITS ALTERNATE BURDENS AND LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING THE SHEEP NIBBLED HEELS OF TURNIPS THAT DOTTED THE GROUND THEIR HEARTS EATEN OUT OF THEM IN FROST BOUND DAYS NOW OVER AND DONE
1737-142397-0037 I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
1737-142397-0038 PERHAPS TOO AT A SPECIAL BIT OF WAGGISHNESS HE HAD STILL IN STORE FOR WHEN AT LAST HE GREW WEARY OF SUCH INSIGNIFICANT EARTHBOUND COMPANY HE DESERTED ME AT A CERTAIN SPOT I KNEW THEN DROPPED SUBSIDED AND SLUNK AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
1737-142397-0039 STOOD THE ANCIENT WHIPPING POST OF THE VILLAGE ITS SIDES FRETTED WITH THE INITIALS OF A GENERATION THAT SCORNED ITS MUTE LESSON BUT STILL CLIPPED BY THE STOUT RUSTY SHACKLES THAT HAD TETHERED THE WRISTS
1737-142397-0040 HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
1737-142397-0041 HAROLD IT FURTHER APPEARED GREATLY COVETING TADPOLES AND TOP HEAVY WITH THE EAGERNESS OF POSSESSION HAD FALLEN INTO THE POND THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOTHING BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO SNEAK IN
1737-142397-0042 BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH
