1737-148989-0012 AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
1737-148989-0013 FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
1737-148989-0014 AND WHISKED HER OVER THE SNOWY ROADS AT A PACE WHICH SET THE BLOOD DANCING IN HER VEINS AND SENT HER HOME STRENGTHENED AND COMFORTED BY SUNSHINE FRESH AIR AND CONGENIAL SOCIETY THREE AIDS YOUNG SUFFERERS SELDOM CAN RESIST
1737-148989-0015 SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
1737-148989-0016 THEN UP WENT THE FLAG OUT RANG THE COLLEGE BELLS BANG WENT TEDDY'S LONG UNUSED CANNON AND A CHORUS OF HAPPY VOICES CRIED THANK GOD AS PEOPLE WENT ABOUT LAUGHING CRYING AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN A RAPTURE OF DELIGHT
1737-148989-0017 FOR MISSUS JO CARRIED THEM IN HER POCKET WHEN MISTER BHAER DID NOT HAVE THEM IN HIS AND BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AT NIGHT NOW THE PROFESSOR WAS HEARD HUMMING LIKE A BIG BEE AGAIN AS HE WENT TO HIS CLASSES
1737-148989-0018 AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
1737-148989-0019 TEDDY STOOD ON HIS HEAD LITERALLY AND TORE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ON OCTOO LIKE A SECOND PAUL REVERE ONLY HIS TIDINGS WERE GOOD BUT BEST OF ALL LITTLE JOSIE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS THE SNOWDROPS DID AND BEGAN TO BLOOM AGAIN GROWING TALL AND QUIET
1737-148989-0020 WITH THE SHADOW OF PAST SORROW TO TONE DOWN HER FORMER VIVACITY AND SHOW THAT SHE HAD LEARNED A LESSON IN TRYING TO ACT WELL HER PART ON THE REAL STAGE WHERE ALL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
1737-148989-0021 THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
1737-148989-0022 THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
1737-148989-0023 WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
1737-148989-0024 QUITE THORNY WAS IT IN FACT AND HARD TO TRAVEL AFTER THE TASTE OF EASE AND PLEASURE HE HAD GOT WHEN NIBBLING AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT BUT HIS CROP OF WILD OATS WAS A LIGHT ONE AND HE RESOLUTELY REAPED WHAT HE HAD SOWED FINDING SOME GOOD WHEAT AMONG THE TARES HE TAUGHT BY DAY
1737-148989-0025 HE FIDDLED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE DINGY LITTLE THEATRE AND HE STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY THAT HIS MASTER WAS WELL PLEASED AND KEPT HIM IN MIND AS ONE TO WHOM PREFERMENT WAS DUE IF ANY CHANCE OCCURRED GAY FRIENDS FORGOT HIM BUT THE OLD ONES STOOD FAST
1737-148989-0026 AND CHEERED HIM UP WHEN HEIMWEH AND WEARINESS MADE HIM SAD AS SPRING CAME ON THINGS MENDED EXPENSES GREW LESS WORK PLEASANTER AND LIFE MORE BEARABLE THAN WHEN WINTRY STORMS BEAT ON HIS THINLY CLAD BACK
1737-148989-0027 AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
1737-148989-0028 SO HE WALKED UNDER THE LINDENS WITH A LIGHTER HEART AND IN THE MAY EVENINGS WENT ABOUT THE CITY WITH A BAND OF STROLLING STUDENTS MAKING MUSIC BEFORE HOUSES WHERE HE USED TO SIT AS GUEST
1737-148989-0029 AND ONCE MINNA THREW HIM MONEY WHICH HE HUMBLY RECEIVED AS PART OF HIS PENANCE BEING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SINS HIS REWARD CAME SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED AND WAS GREATER THAN HE DESERVED HE THOUGHT THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY WHEN HIS MASTER ONE DAY INFORMED HIM
1737-148989-0030 THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
1737-148989-0031 AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
1737-148989-0032 KIND WISHES AND COMFORTABLE GIFTS FOR THE LONELY FELLOW WHO COULD HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR NECKS AND CRIED LIKE A GIRL AT SEEING HIS OLD MATES AGAIN HOW GLAD HE WAS TO BE FOUND IN HIS LITTLE ROOM BUSY AT HIS PROPER WORK NOT LIVING LIKE AN IDLE GENTLEMAN ON BORROWED MONEY
1737-148989-0033 HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
1737-148989-0034 HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
1737-148989-0035 AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
1737-148989-0036 HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
1737-148989-0037 THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
1737-148989-0038 WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
1737-148989-0039 AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
1737-148989-0040 AS HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT HAD DONE SINCE A CERTAIN LITTLE WHITE HAND HAD LAID IN IT CONFIDINGLY I'LL MAKE EM PROUD OF ME YET AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THIS AWFUL YEAR I CAN WIPE IT OUT AND I WILL SO HELP ME GOD
