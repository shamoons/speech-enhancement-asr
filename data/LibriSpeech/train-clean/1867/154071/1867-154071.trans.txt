1867-154071-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT TWO APPARITIONS
1867-154071-0001 FOUND A BIG DOUBLE ROOM THAT RAN ACROSS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK IT LOOKED DOWN ON THE LIGHTS GLIMMERING ON THE BLACK EAST RIVER AND ACROSS TO THE FLARE OF BROOKLYN TO THE LEFT THE WHOLE ARC OF THE FIFTY NINTH STREET BRIDGE WAS EXPOSED
1867-154071-0002 HERE THEY TOOK UP THE VIGIL
1867-154071-0003 BILL GREGG SHOOK HIS HEAD THAT'S NOT THE ONE SHE'S ALL DIFFERENT A PILE DIFFERENT RONICKY RONICKY SIGHED
1867-154071-0004 GO ON BACK TO SLEEP I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
1867-154071-0005 GHOST HOURS OF THE EARLY MORNING THEY DID NOT RELAX THEIR VIGIL
1867-154071-0006 APPARENTLY THE PLACE WAS A HARMLESS ROOMING HOUSE OF FAIRLY GOOD QUALITY NOT A SIGN OF CAROLINE SMITH APPEARED EVEN DURING THE SECOND DAY
1867-154071-0007 BY THIS TIME THE NERVES OF THE TWO WATCHERS WERE SHATTERED BY THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND THE MONOTONOUS VIEW FROM THE FRONT WINDOW WAS BEGINNING TO MADDEN THEM IT'S PROOF THAT SHE AIN'T YONDER SAID BILL GREGG
1867-154071-0008 AND HE GREW PALE AT THE THOUGHT PARTNER SAID RONICKY DOONE IF THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM US THEY SURE HAVE THE SENSE TO KEEP HER UNDER COVER FOR AS LONG AS TWO DAYS AIN'T THAT RIGHT
1867-154071-0009 IT'S JUST ABOUT OUR LAST CHANCE BILL WE'VE DONE OUR HUNTING PRETTY NEAR AS WELL AS WE COULD IF WE DON'T LAND HER THIS TRIP I'M ABOUT READY TO GIVE UP
1867-154071-0010 ONE WEEK WAS DECIDED ON AS A FAIR TEST IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME CAROLINE SMITH DID NOT COME OUT OF THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET THEY COULD CONCLUDE THAT SHE DID NOT STAY THERE
1867-154071-0011 PEERING THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE DRAWN CURTAINS WHICH SHELTERED HIM FROM BEING OBSERVED AT HIS SPYING WHEN HE CALLED OUT SOFTLY THE SOUND BROUGHT GREGG WITH ONE LONG LEAP OUT OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING TO THE WINDOW THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT IT
1867-154071-0012 THERE STOOD CAROLINE SMITH IN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND WALKING TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS PAUSED THERE AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET BILL GREGG GROANED
1867-154071-0013 SNATCHED HIS HAT AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DOOR AND RONICKY HEARD THE BRIEF THUNDER OF HIS FEET DOWN THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEN THE HEAVY THUMPS AS HE RACED AROUND THE LANDING
1867-154071-0014 AND SO SWIFT WAS THAT DESCENT THAT WHEN THE GIRL IDLING DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE STREET CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK BILL GREGG RUSHED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND RAN TOWARD HER
1867-154071-0015 FOR NEVER HAD THE MINER SEEMED SO CLUMSILY BIG AND GAUNT NEVER HAD HIS CLOTHES SEEMED SO UNPRESSED AND SHAPELESS WHILE HIS SOFT GRAY HAT TO WHICH HE STILL CLUNG RELIGIOUSLY APPEARED HOPELESSLY OUT OF PLACE IN CONTRAST WITH THE SLIM PRETTINESS OF THE GIRL
1867-154071-0016 SHE WORE A BLACK STRAW HAT TURNED BACK FROM HER FACE WITH A SINGLE BIG RED FLOWER AT THE SIDE OF IT
1867-154071-0017 THE SAME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR CLOTHES WAS IN THEIR FACES THE FINELY MODELED PRETTINESS OF HER FEATURES AND THE BIG CARELESS CHISELING OF THE FEATURES OF BILL GREGG RONICKY DOONE DID NOT WONDER THAT AFTER HER FIRST FEAR HER GESTURE WAS ONE OF DISDAIN AND SURPRISE
1867-154071-0018 HE WENT A LONG SLOW STEP CLOSER TO HER WITH BOTH HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
1867-154071-0019 RONICKY DOONE FOLLOWED THAT GLANCE AND HE SAW ALL HIDDEN SAVE THE PROFILE OF THE FACE
1867-154071-0020 WHAT A FACE IT WAS NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD RONICKY DOONE SEEN A MAN WHO IN ONE INSTANT FILLED HIM WITH SUCH FEAR AND HATRED SUCH LOATHING AND SUCH DREAD SUCH SCORN AND SUCH TERROR
1867-154071-0021 THE NOSE WAS HOOKED LIKE THE NOSE OF A BIRD OF PREY THE EYES WERE LONG AND SLANTING LIKE THOSE OF AN ORIENTAL THE FACE WAS THIN ALMOST FLESHLESS SO THAT THE BONY JAW STOOD OUT LIKE THE JAW OF A DEATH'S HEAD
1867-154071-0022 THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
1867-154071-0023 FOR SHE MADE A SLIGHT OUTWARD GESTURE WITH ONE HAND IF THIS WERE IN HER MIND HOWEVER IT VANISHED INSTANTLY SHE TURNED WITH A SHUDDER AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET
1867-154071-0024 AS FOR BILL GREGG HE BORE HIMSELF STRAIGHT AS A SOLDIER AND CAME BACK ACROSS THE PAVEMENT BUT IT WAS THE ERECTNESS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAS MET WITH A CRUSHING DEFEAT AND ONLY PRESERVES AN OUTWARD RESOLUTION WHILE ALL THE SPIRIT WITHIN IS CRUSHED
1867-154071-0025 WHAT A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ASCENT AND THE DESCENT HE HAD LITERALLY FLOWN DOWN NOW HIS HEELS CLUMPED OUT A SLOW AND REGULAR DEATH MARCH AS HE CAME BACK TO THE ROOM WHEN GREGG OPENED THE DOOR
1867-154071-0026 RONICKY DOONE BLINKED AND DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AT THE SIGHT OF THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE GREGG HAD KNOWN BEFORE THAT HE TRULY LOVED THIS GIRL WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN
1867-154071-0027 NOW IN THE VERY MOMENT OF SEEING HIS DREAM OF THE GIRL TURNED INTO FLESH AND BLOOD HE HAD LOST HER AND THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE DEATH IN THE FACE OF THE BIG MINER AS HE DROPPED HIS HAT ON THE FLOOR AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
1867-154071-0028 AFTER THAT HE DID NOT MOVE SO MUCH AS A FINGER FROM THE POSITION INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN LIMPLY HIS LEGS WERE TWISTED AWKWARDLY SPRAWLING ACROSS THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIM ONE LONG ARM DRAGGED DOWN TOWARD THE FLOOR
1867-154071-0029 AS IF THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN IT TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE LABOR HARDENED HANDS HIS CHIN WAS FALLEN AGAINST HIS BREAST WHEN RONICKY DOONE CROSSED TO HIM AND LAID A KIND HAND ON HIS SHOULDER HE DID NOT LOOK UP IT'S ENDED
1867-154071-0030 SAID BILL GREGG FAINTLY NOW WE HIT THE BACK TRAIL AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS HE ADDED WITH A FAINT ATTEMPT AT CYNICISM I'VE JUST WASTED A PILE OF GOOD MONEY MAKING TIME FROM THE MINE THAT'S ALL
1867-154071-0031 SAID RONICKY DOONE BILL LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME MAN TO MAN THAT YOU'RE A LIAR HE ADDED CAN YOU EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER MAN THE CRUELTY OF THAT SPEECH MADE GREGG FLUSH
1867-154071-0032 SAID GREGG HUSKILY AIN'T THERE THAT'S WHERE YOU AND ME DON'T AGREE
1867-154071-0033 LOOK AT THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE YOU START OUT WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF A GIRL NOW YOU'VE FOLLOWED HER FOUND HER NAME
1867-154071-0034 AIN'T THAT SOMETHING DONE AFTER YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT
1867-154071-0035 NOT YOU BILL YOU'RE GOING TO BUCK UP AND GO AHEAD FULL STEAM
1867-154071-0036 BILL GREGG SMILED SOURLY
1867-154071-0037 D'YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID WELL BILL GREGG SHE SAYS I DON'T REMEMBER ANY SUCH NAME THAT TOOK THE WIND OUT OF ME I ONLY HAD ENOUGH LEFT TO SAY
1867-154071-0038 THE GENT THAT WAS WRITING THOSE PAPERS TO THE CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL TO YOU FROM THE WEST THE ONE YOU SENT YOUR PICTURE TO AND SENT MY PICTURE TO SHE SAYS AND LOOKS AS IF THE GROUND HAD OPENED UNDER HER FEET YOU'RE MAD SHE SAYS
1867-154071-0039 AND THEN SHE LOOKS BACK OVER HER SHOULDER AS MUCH AS TO WISH SHE WAS SAFE BACK IN HER HOUSE D'YOU KNOW WHY SHE LOOKED BACK OVER HER SHOULDER JUST FOR THE REASON I TOLD YOU NO BILL THERE WAS A GENT STANDING UP THERE AT A WINDOW WATCHING HER AND HOW SHE ACTED
1867-154071-0040 HE'S THE ONE WHO'S KEPT HER IN THAT HOUSE
1867-154071-0041 THAT SENT OUT THE GIRL WITH EXACT ORDERS HOW SHE SHOULD ACT IF YOU WAS TO COME OUT AND SPEAK TO HER WHEN YOU SEEN HER BILL WHAT THAT GIRL TOLD YOU DIDN'T COME OUT OF HER OWN HEAD IT COME OUT OF THE HEAD OF THE GENT ACROSS THE WAY WHEN YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON HER
1867-154071-0042 SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE'D RUN AFTER YOU AND TRY TO EXPLAIN BUT THE FEAR OF THAT FELLOW UP IN THE WINDOW WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER AND SHE DIDN'T DARE BILL
1867-154071-0043 YOU GOT TO GET THAT GENT I SEEN GRINNING FROM THE WINDOW GRINNING ASKED BILL GREGG GRINDING HIS TEETH AND STARTING FROM HIS CHAIR WAS THE SKUNK LAUGHING AT ME SURE EVERY MINUTE BILL GREGG GROANED I'LL SMASH EVERY BONE IN HIS UGLY HEAD
1867-154071-0044 SHAKE SAID RONICKY DOONE THAT'S THE SORT OF TALK I WANTED TO HEAR
