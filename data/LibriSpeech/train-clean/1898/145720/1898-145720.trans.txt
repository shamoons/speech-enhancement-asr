1898-145720-0000 FAR AWAY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE RED INDIANS DWELL
1898-145720-0001 MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
1898-145720-0002 BUT FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET HE SAT BY THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS LAID THINKING OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT WAS BURIED THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME TO HIM OUT OF THE DARKNESS
1898-145720-0003 HE REMEMBERED HAVING HEARD FROM THE OLD OLD PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE WAS A PATH THAT LED TO THE LAND OF SOULS THAT IF YOU SOUGHT CAREFULLY YOU COULD FIND IT
1898-145720-0004 SO THE NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP EARLY AND PUT SOME FOOD IN HIS POUCH AND SLUNG AN EXTRA SKIN OVER HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG HIS JOURNEY WOULD TAKE NOR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONLY ONE THING HE KNEW
1898-145720-0005 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SAY THAT THE LAND OF SOULS LAY TO THE SOUTH AND SO FILLED WITH NEW HOPE AND COURAGE HE SET HIS FACE SOUTHWARDS FOR MANY MANY MILES THE COUNTRY LOOKED THE SAME AS IT DID ROUND HIS OWN HOME
1898-145720-0006 BUT GREW LESS AND LESS THE FARTHER HE WENT SOUTH TILL IT DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER SOON THE TREES PUT FORTH THEIR BUDS AND FLOWERS SPRANG UP UNDER HIS FEET AND INSTEAD OF THICK CLOUDS THERE WAS BLUE SKY OVER HIS HEAD AND EVERYWHERE THE BIRDS WERE SINGING
1898-145720-0007 AND ON THE TOP OF THESE HE FOUND A HUT OR WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND HOLDING A STAFF IN HIS HAND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
1898-145720-0008 REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
1898-145720-0009 TO SUFFER HIM TO REST AND WHEN HE AROSE THE OLD MAN ROSE TOO AND STOOD WITH HIM AT THE DOOR LOOK HE SAID
1898-145720-0010 AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
1898-145720-0011 BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
1898-145720-0012 INSTEAD OF HIDING AS HE APPROACHED AND BIRDS CIRCLED ROUND HIM
1898-145720-0013 VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
1898-145720-0014 WHEN TO HIS JOY AND WONDER HE SAW FOLLOWING HIM IN ANOTHER CANOE EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN THE MAIDEN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD MADE THIS LONG JOURNEY BUT THEY COULD NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER FOR BETWEEN THEM ROLLED GREAT WAVES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY WOULD SINK THE BOATS
1898-145720-0015 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
1898-145720-0016 SO THEY REACHED UNHURT THE SHORE OF THE HAPPY ISLAND AND WANDERED THROUGH THE FLOWERY FIELDS AND BY THE BANKS OF RUSHING STREAMS AND THEY KNEW NOT HUNGER NOR THIRST NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT
1898-145720-0017 BUT IN THE MURMUR OF THE WIND HE HEARD THE MASTER OF LIFE SAYING TO HIM RETURN WHITHER YOU CAME FOR I HAVE WORK FOR YOU TO DO AND YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU AND FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHALL RULE OVER THEM
1898-145720-0018 AT THE GATE MY MESSENGER AWAITS YOU AND YOU SHALL TAKE AGAIN
