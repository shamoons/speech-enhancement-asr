1926-143879-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE ISABEL CAME BACK TO FLORENCE BUT ONLY AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AN INTERVAL SUFFICIENTLY REPLETE WITH INCIDENT IT IS NOT HOWEVER DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT WE ARE CLOSELY CONCERNED WITH HER
1926-143879-0001 OUR ATTENTION IS ENGAGED AGAIN ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE LATE SPRING TIME SHORTLY AFTER HER RETURN TO PALAZZO CRESCENTINI
1926-143879-0002 TO SOCIAL USES AND THERE WAS THAT IN HER EXPRESSION AND ATTITUDE
1926-143879-0003 THE TALL WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THOUGH ITS GREEN SHUTTERS WERE PARTLY DRAWN THE BRIGHT AIR OF THE GARDEN HAD COME IN THROUGH A BROAD INTERSTICE AND FILLED THE ROOM WITH WARMTH
1926-143879-0004 TOO TROUBLED FOR ATTENTION SHE MOVED IN A VAIN CIRCLE
1926-143879-0005 SINCE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE WAS NOT THROUGH THE GARDEN IN WHICH STILLNESS AND PRIVACY ALWAYS REIGNED SHE WISHED RATHER TO FORESTALL HIS ARRIVAL BY A PROCESS OF CONJECTURE AND TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE THIS ATTEMPT GAVE HER PLENTY TO DO
1926-143879-0006 GRAVE SHE FOUND HERSELF AND POSITIVELY MORE WEIGHTED AS BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAPSE OF THE YEAR SHE HAD SPENT IN SEEING THE WORLD
1926-143879-0007 A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
1926-143879-0008 IF HER THOUGHTS JUST NOW HAD INCLINED THEMSELVES TO RETROSPECT INSTEAD OF FLUTTERING THEIR WINGS NERVOUSLY ABOUT THE PRESENT
1926-143879-0009 WITH SEVERAL OF THE IMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ON SUCH A FIELD WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED
1926-143879-0010 SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND BEHIND HER BUT HAD BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TO WHOM ISABEL NOW PLAYED WITH EQUAL MUNIFICENCE AND TENDERNESS THE PART OF MAIDEN AUNT MISTER LUDLOW
1926-143879-0011 THE LITTLE LUDLOWS HAD NOT YET EVEN FROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW
1926-143879-0012 LILY AND THE BABIES HAD JOINED HER IN SWITZERLAND IN THE MONTH OF JULY AND THEY HAD SPENT A SUMMER OF FINE WEATHER IN AN ALPINE VALLEY WHERE THE FLOWERS WERE THICK IN THE MEADOWS
1926-143879-0013 AND THE SHADE OF GREAT CHESTNUTS MADE A RESTING PLACE FOR SUCH UPWARD WANDERINGS AS MIGHT BE UNDERTAKEN BY LADIES AND CHILDREN ON WARM AFTERNOONS THEY HAD AFTERWARDS REACHED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WHICH WAS WORSHIPPED
1926-143879-0014 AND WITH COSTLY CEREMONIES BY LILY BUT THOUGHT OF AS NOISILY VACANT BY ISABEL WHO IN THESE DAYS MADE
1926-143879-0015 MISSUS LUDLOW SACRIFICED AS I SAY TO PARIS YET HAD DOUBTS AND WONDERMENTS NOT ALLAYED AT THAT ALTAR AND AFTER HER HUSBAND HAD JOINED HER FOUND FURTHER CHAGRIN IN HIS FAILURE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THESE SPECULATIONS
1926-143879-0016 MISSUS LUDLOW'S MENTAL MOTIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS
1926-143879-0017 WHICH HAD AN ELEGANT CONSERVATORY AND WAS JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM HER OWN AT ANOTHER
1926-143879-0018 ON THE WHOLE AS I HAVE SAID SHE HAD FALLEN FROM HIGH COMMUNION WITH THE PROBABILITIES
1926-143879-0019 ISABEL HAD DEVELOPED LESS HOWEVER THAN LILY HAD THOUGHT LIKELY DEVELOPMENT TO LILY'S UNDERSTANDING BEING SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH MORNING CALLS AND EVENING PARTIES INTELLECTUALLY DOUBTLESS SHE HAD MADE IMMENSE STRIDES
1926-143879-0020 THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
1926-143879-0021 WE KNOW OURSELVES THAT ISABEL HAD MADE CONQUESTS WHETHER INFERIOR OR NOT TO THOSE SHE MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED IN HER NATIVE LAND
1926-143879-0022 THAN THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC TO SAY NOTHING AND DRINKING DEEP IN SECRET OF ROMANCE SHE WAS AS LITTLE DISPOSED TO ASK POOR LILY'S ADVICE AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THAT RARE VOLUME FOREVER
1926-143879-0023 BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF THESE DISCRIMINATIONS AND COULD ONLY PRONOUNCE HER SISTER'S CAREER A STRANGE ANTI CLIMAX AN IMPRESSION CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT ISABEL'S SILENCE ABOUT MISTER OSMOND FOR INSTANCE
1926-143879-0024 WAS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH HE OCCUPIED HER THOUGHTS AS THIS HAPPENED VERY OFTEN IT SOMETIMES APPEARED TO MISSUS LUDLOW THAT SHE HAD LOST HER COURAGE SO UNCANNY A RESULT OF SO EXHILARATING AN INCIDENT AS INHERITING A FORTUNE
1926-143879-0025 IT MADE LILY SO FIDGETY AND SHE ASKED SUCH IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS ISABEL WATCHED THE TRAIN MOVE AWAY SHE KISSED HER HAND TO THE ELDER OF HER SMALL NEPHEWS
1926-143879-0026 THE EARLY DUSK OF A NOVEMBER AFTERNOON HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN THE STREET LAMPS IN THE THICK BROWN AIR LOOKED WEAK AND RED
1926-143879-0027 AND EUSTON SQUARE WAS A LONG WAY FROM PICCADILLY BUT ISABEL PERFORMED THE JOURNEY WITH A POSITIVE ENJOYMENT OF ITS DANGERS AND LOST HER WAY ALMOST ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO GET MORE SENSATIONS SO THAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN AN OBLIGING POLICEMAN EASILY
1926-143879-0028 SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
1926-143879-0029 SHE MADE HER WAY DOWN TO ROME WITHOUT TOUCHING AT FLORENCE
1926-143879-0030 IN THE SEPTEMBER PREVIOUS HAD BEEN RECALLED TO AMERICA BY A TELEGRAM FROM THE INTERVIEWER
1926-143879-0031 AND HENRIETTA WAS CHEERED ON HER WAY BY A PROMISE FROM MISTER BANTLING THAT HE WOULD SOON COME OVER
1926-143879-0032 HAD NOT BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN ROME BEFORE SHE PROPOSED TO MADAME MERLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE TO THE EAST MADAME MERLE REMARKED THAT HER FRIEND WAS RESTLESS
1926-143879-0033 BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO VISIT ATHENS AND CONSTANTINOPLE THE TWO LADIES ACCORDINGLY EMBARKED ON THIS EXPEDITION AND SPENT THREE MONTHS IN GREECE IN TURKEY IN EGYPT
1926-143879-0034 ISABEL FOUND MUCH TO INTEREST HER IN THESE COUNTRIES THOUGH MADAME MERLE CONTINUED TO REMARK THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST CLASSIC SITES
1926-143879-0035 HER CHARACTER HAD REVEALED ITSELF
1926-143879-0036 A CONSUMMATION THE MORE DESIRABLE
1926-143879-0037 SHE CONSIDERED WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH THAT A MORALITY DIFFERING FROM HER OWN MUST BE INFERIOR TO IT
1926-143879-0038 AN OCCASIONAL LAPSE FROM CANDOUR IN THE CONVERSATION OF A PERSON WHO HAD RAISED DELICATE KINDNESS TO AN ART AND WHOSE PRIDE WAS TOO HIGH FOR THE NARROW WAYS OF DECEPTION
1926-143879-0039 AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IN HER LIST OF WHICH OUR HEROINE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD SHE HAD NOT HEARD OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS VERY PLAIN
1926-143879-0040 ADVANTAGEOUS TO HEAR SHE HAD ONCE OR TWICE HAD A POSITIVE SCARE SINCE IT SO AFFECTED HER TO HAVE TO EXCLAIM OF HER FRIEND
1926-143879-0041 BUT IT STOOD FOR A HIGH WATER MARK IN THE EBB AND FLOW OF CONFIDENCE MADAME MERLE HAD ONCE DECLARED HER BELIEF THAT WHEN A FRIENDSHIP CEASES TO GROW IT IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO DECLINE THERE BEING NO POINT OF EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN LIKING MORE AND LIKING LESS
1926-143879-0042 A STATIONARY AFFECTION IN OTHER WORDS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE THE GIRL HAD IN THESE DAYS A THOUSAND USES FOR HER SENSE OF THE ROMANTIC WHICH WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN
1926-143879-0043 I DO NOT ALLUDE TO THE IMPULSE IT RECEIVED AS SHE GAZED AT THE PYRAMIDS IN THE COURSE OF AN EXCURSION FROM CAIRO OR AS SHE STOOD AMONG THE BROKEN COLUMNS OF THE ACROPOLIS AND FIXED HER EYES UPON THE POINT DESIGNATED TO HER AS THE STRAIT OF SALAMIS
1926-143879-0044 DEEP AND MEMORABLE AS THESE EMOTIONS HAD REMAINED SHE CAME BACK BY THE LAST OF MARCH FROM EGYPT AND GREECE AND MADE ANOTHER STAY IN ROME A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL
1926-143879-0045 DURING WHICH THE FACT OF HER BEING WITH HIS OLD FRIEND MADAME MERLE IN WHOSE HOUSE SHE HAD GONE TO LODGE MADE IT VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER EVERY DAY WHEN THE LAST OF APRIL CAME
1926-143879-0046 AND WENT TO PAY A VISIT AT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI MADAME MERLE ON THIS OCCASION REMAINING IN ROME
