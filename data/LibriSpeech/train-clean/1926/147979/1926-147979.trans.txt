1926-147979-0000 WINTER LIES TOO LONG IN COUNTRY TOWNS HANGS ON UNTIL IT IS STALE AND SHABBY OLD AND SULLEN ON THE FARM THE WEATHER WAS THE GREAT FACT AND MEN'S AFFAIRS WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT AS THE STREAMS CREEP UNDER THE ICE
1926-147979-0001 BUT IN BLACK HAWK THE SCENE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS SPREAD OUT SHRUNKEN AND PINCHED FROZEN DOWN TO THE BARE STALK
1926-147979-0002 THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I WENT TO THE RIVER WITH THE HARLINGS ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND WE SKATED UP TO THE BIG ISLAND AND MADE BONFIRES ON THE FROZEN SAND BUT BY MARCH THE ICE WAS ROUGH AND CHOPPY
1926-147979-0003 AT OUR COMFORTABLE HOTEL MISSUS HARLING HAD KNOWN D'ARNAULT FOR YEARS
1926-147979-0004 THE WIND FROM WITHOUT MADE WAVES IN THE LONG CARPET A COAL STOVE GLOWED AT EITHER END OF THE ROOM AND THE GRAND PIANO IN THE MIDDLE STOOD OPEN THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNUSUAL FREEDOM ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT
1926-147979-0005 FOR MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA FOR A WEEK JOHNNIE HAD BEEN HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUESTS UNTIL HE WAS RATHER ABSENT MINDED IT WAS MISSUS GARDENER WHO RAN THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED AFTER EVERYTHING HER HUSBAND STOOD AT THE DESK AND WELCOMED INCOMING TRAVELERS
1926-147979-0006 HE WAS A POPULAR FELLOW BUT NO MANAGER MISSUS GARDENER WAS ADMITTEDLY THE BEST DRESSED WOMAN IN BLACK HAWK DROVE THE BEST HORSE AND HAD A SMART TRAP AND A LITTLE WHITE AND GOLD SLEIGH
1926-147979-0007 SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
1926-147979-0008 GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
1926-147979-0009 TWO CLASSES THOSE WHO HAD SEEN MISSUS GARDENER'S DIAMONDS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT WHEN I STOLE INTO THE PARLOR ANSON KIRKPATRICK MARSHALL FIELD'S MAN
1926-147979-0010 HE WAS A DAPPER LITTLE IRISHMAN VERY VAIN HOMELY AS A MONKEY WITH FRIENDS EVERYWHERE AND A SWEETHEART IN EVERY PORT LIKE A SAILOR I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE MEN WHO WERE SITTING ABOUT BUT I RECOGNIZED A FURNITURE SALESMAN FROM KANSAS CITY
1926-147979-0011 A DRUG MAN AND WILLY O'REILLY WHO TRAVELED FOR A JEWELRY HOUSE AND SOLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TALK WAS ALL ABOUT GOOD AND BAD HOTELS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND MUSICAL PRODIGIES I LEARNED THAT MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA TO HEAR BOOTH AND BARRETT
1926-147979-0012 WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
1926-147979-0013 HIS YELLOW FACE WAS LIFTED IN THE LIGHT WITH A SHOW OF WHITE TEETH ALL GRINNING AND HIS SHRUNKEN PAPERY EYELIDS LAY MOTIONLESS OVER HIS BLIND EYES GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN NO LADIES HERE GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN
1926-147979-0014 WE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC SOME OF YOU GENTLEMEN GOING TO PLAY FOR ME THIS EVENING IT WAS THE SOFT AMIABLE NEGRO VOICE LIKE THOSE I REMEMBERED FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH THE NOTE OF DOCILE SUBSERVIENCE IN IT
1926-147979-0015 HE HAD THE NEGRO HEAD TOO ALMOST NO HEAD AT ALL NOTHING BEHIND THE EARS BUT FOLDS OF NECK UNDER CLOSE CLIPPED WOOL
1926-147979-0016 WHEN HE WAS SITTING OR STANDING STILL HE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH INCESSANTLY LIKE A ROCKING TOY AT THE PIANO HE SWAYED IN TIME TO THE MUSIC AND WHEN HE WAS NOT PLAYING HIS BODY KEPT UP THIS MOTION LIKE AN EMPTY MILL GRINDING ON
1926-147979-0017 NOW GENTLEMEN I EXPECT YOU'VE ALL GOT GRAND VOICES SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD OLD PLANTATION SONGS TO NIGHT THE MEN GATHERED ROUND HIM AS HE BEGAN TO PLAY MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME THEY SANG ONE NEGRO MELODY AFTER ANOTHER
1926-147979-0018 WHILE THE MULATTO SAT ROCKING HIMSELF HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS YELLOW FACE LIFTED ITS SHRIVELED EYELIDS NEVER FLUTTERING HE WAS BORN IN THE FAR SOUTH ON THE D'ARNAULT PLANTATION WHERE THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE FACT OF SLAVERY PERSISTED
1926-147979-0019 WHEN HE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD HE HAD AN ILLNESS WHICH LEFT HIM TOTALLY BLIND
1926-147979-0020 HIS MOTHER A BUXOM YOUNG NEGRO WENCH WHO WAS LAUNDRESS FOR THE D'ARNAULTS CONCLUDED THAT HER BLIND BABY WAS NOT RIGHT IN HIS HEAD AND SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HIM SHE LOVED HIM DEVOTEDLY BUT HE WAS SO UGLY WITH HIS SUNKEN EYES AND HIS FIDGETS
1926-147979-0021 THAT SHE HID HIM AWAY FROM PEOPLE ALL THE DAINTIES SHE BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE BIG HOUSE WERE FOR THE BLIND CHILD AND SHE BEAT AND CUFFED HER OTHER CHILDREN WHENEVER SHE FOUND THEM TEASING HIM OR TRYING TO GET HIS CHICKEN BONE AWAY FROM HIM HE BEGAN TO TALK EARLY
1926-147979-0022 AND HIS MAMMY SAID HE WAS N'T ALL WRONG SHE NAMED HIM SAMSON BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND BUT ON THE PLANTATION HE WAS KNOWN AS YELLOW MARTHA'S SIMPLE CHILD
1926-147979-0023 HE WAS DOCILE AND OBEDIENT BUT WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS TAKING THE SAME DIRECTION HE FELT HIS WAY THROUGH THE LILACS ALONG THE BOXWOOD HEDGE
1926-147979-0024 WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIM SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE CABIN SHE WHIPPED HIM UNMERCIFULLY AND TOLD HIM WHAT DREADFUL THINGS OLD MISTER D'ARNAULT WOULD DO TO HIM IF HE EVER FOUND HIM NEAR THE BIG HOUSE BUT THE NEXT TIME SAMSON HAD A CHANCE HE RAN AWAY AGAIN
1926-147979-0025 AND WENT TOWARD THE WINDOW SHE SAW THIS HIDEOUS LITTLE PICKANINNY DRESSED IN AN OLD PIECE OF SACKING STANDING IN THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE HOLLYHOCK ROWS HIS BODY ROCKING AUTOMATICALLY HIS BLIND FACE LIFTED
1926-147979-0026 THOUGH IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHER CHILDREN ONE DAY SAMSON WAS STANDING THUS WHILE MISS NELLIE WAS PLAYING HER LESSON TO HER MUSIC MASTER THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN
1926-147979-0027 TALK A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN LEAVE THE ROOM HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AFTER THEM HE CREPT UP TO THE FRONT WINDOWS AND STUCK HIS HEAD IN THERE WAS NO ONE THERE HE COULD ALWAYS DETECT THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE IN A ROOM
1926-147979-0028 HE PUT ONE FOOT OVER THE WINDOW SILL AND STRADDLED IT HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER HOW HIS MASTER WOULD GIVE HIM TO THE BIG MASTIFF IF HE EVER FOUND HIM MEDDLING SAMSON HAD GOT TOO NEAR THE MASTIFF'S KENNEL ONCE AND HAD FELT HIS TERRIBLE BREATH IN HIS FACE
1926-147979-0029 HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT HE PULLED IN HIS OTHER FOOT THROUGH THE DARK HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE THING TO ITS MOUTH HE TOUCHED IT SOFTLY AND IT ANSWERED SOFTLY KINDLY HE SHIVERED AND STOOD STILL
1926-147979-0030 THEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL IT ALL OVER RAN HIS FINGER TIPS ALONG THE SLIPPERY SIDES EMBRACED THE CARVED LEGS TRIED TO GET SOME CONCEPTION OF ITS SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE SPACE IT OCCUPIED IN PRIMEVAL NIGHT
1926-147979-0031 IT WAS COLD AND HARD AND LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN HIS BLACK UNIVERSE HE WENT BACK TO ITS MOUTH BEGAN AT ONE END OF THE KEYBOARD AND FELT HIS WAY DOWN INTO THE MELLOW THUNDER AS FAR AS HE COULD GO
1926-147979-0032 HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
1926-147979-0033 THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
1926-147979-0034 HE WAS FEELING OUT THE PATTERN THAT LAY ALL READY MADE ON THE BIG AND LITTLE KEYS WHEN HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THE SOUND WAS WRONG AND HE WANTED ANOTHER MISS NELLIE SPOKE SOFTLY HE WHIRLED ABOUT IN A SPASM OF TERROR
1926-147979-0035 LEAPED FORWARD IN THE DARK STRUCK HIS HEAD ON THE OPEN WINDOW AND FELL SCREAMING AND BLEEDING TO THE FLOOR HE HAD WHAT HIS MOTHER CALLED A FIT THE DOCTOR CAME AND GAVE HIM OPIUM WHEN SAMSON WAS WELL AGAIN HIS YOUNG MISTRESS LED HIM BACK TO THE PIANO

1926-147979-0037 AS PIANO PLAYING IT WAS PERHAPS ABOMINABLE BUT AS MUSIC IT WAS SOMETHING REAL VITALIZED BY A SENSE OF RHYTHM THAT WAS STRONGER THAN HIS OTHER PHYSICAL SENSES THAT NOT ONLY FILLED HIS DARK MIND BUT WORRIED HIS BODY INCESSANTLY
1926-147979-0038 AND HE WERE GLOATING OVER THEM AND TRICKLING THEM THROUGH HIS YELLOW FINGERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRASHING WALTZ D'ARNAULT SUDDENLY BEGAN TO PLAY SOFTLY AND TURNING TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND HIM WHISPERED
