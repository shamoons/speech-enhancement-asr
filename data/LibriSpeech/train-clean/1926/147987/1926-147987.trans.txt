1926-147987-0000 THE DAY AFTER THE CUTTERS LEFT ANTONIA CAME OVER TO SEE US GRANDMOTHER NOTICED THAT SHE SEEMED TROUBLED AND DISTRACTED YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND ANTONIA SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
1926-147987-0001 SHE HESITATED AND THEN TOLD US HOW STRANGELY MISTER CUTTER HAD BEHAVED BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
1926-147987-0002 AS HE HAD JUST PUT A NEW YALE LOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR CUTTER HAD BEEN SO INSISTENT IN REGARD TO THESE DETAILS THAT NOW SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT STAYING THERE ALONE
1926-147987-0003 OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
1926-147987-0004 GRANDMOTHER WAS APPREHENSIVE AT ONCE I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU TO STAY THERE FEELING THAT WAY I SUPPOSE IT WOULD N'T BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE PLACE ALONE EITHER
1926-147987-0005 MAYBE JIM WOULD BE WILLING TO GO OVER THERE AND SLEEP AND YOU COULD COME HERE NIGHTS I'D FEEL SAFER KNOWING YOU WERE UNDER MY OWN ROOF I GUESS JIM COULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR SILVER AND OLD USURY NOTES AS WELL AS YOU COULD
1926-147987-0006 ANTONIA TURNED TO ME EAGERLY OH WOULD YOU JIM
1926-147987-0007 THE THIRD NIGHT I SPENT AT THE CUTTERS I AWOKE SUDDENLY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD HEARD A DOOR OPEN AND SHUT EVERYTHING WAS STILL HOWEVER AND I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
1926-147987-0008 I WAS ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT I DECIDED THAT HE MIGHT TAKE THE CUTTERS SILVER WHOEVER HE WAS
1926-147987-0009 I HELD MY BREATH AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL A HAND CLOSED SOFTLY ON MY SHOULDER AND AT THE SAME MOMENT I FELT SOMETHING HAIRY AND COLOGNE SCENTED BRUSHING MY FACE
1926-147987-0010 THE MAN BECAME INSANE HE STOOD OVER ME CHOKING ME WITH ONE FIST AND BEATING ME IN THE FACE WITH THE OTHER HISSING AND CHUCKLING AND LETTING OUT A FLOOD OF ABUSE SO THIS IS WHAT SHE'S UP TO WHEN I'M AWAY IS IT WHERE IS SHE YOU NASTY WHELP
1926-147987-0011 WHERE IS SHE UNDER THE BED ARE YOU HUSSY I KNOW YOUR TRICKS WAIT TILL I GET AT YOU I'LL FIX THIS RAT YOU'VE GOT IN HERE HE'S CAUGHT ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS CUTTER HAD ME BY THE THROAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR ME AT ALL
1926-147987-0012 WHEN I GOT HOME I CLIMBED IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW I WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM MY NOSE AND LIP BUT I WAS TOO SICK TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I FOUND A SHAWL AND AN OVERCOAT ON THE HATRACK LAY DOWN ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND IN SPITE OF MY HURTS WENT TO SLEEP
1926-147987-0013 HER CRY OF FRIGHT AWAKENED ME TRULY I WAS A BATTERED OBJECT AS SHE HELPED ME TO MY ROOM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR MY LIP WAS CUT AND STOOD OUT LIKE A SNOUT MY NOSE LOOKED LIKE A BIG BLUE PLUM
1926-147987-0014 AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
1926-147987-0015 SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH I WAS TOO FAINT AND MISERABLE TO GO INTO EXPLANATIONS WHEN SHE TOOK
1926-147987-0016 SHE SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING BATHING AND POULTICING ME AND RUBBING ME WITH ARNICA I HEARD ANTONIA SOBBING OUTSIDE MY DOOR BUT I ASKED GRANDMOTHER TO SEND HER AWAY I FELT THAT I NEVER WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN
1926-147987-0017 SHE HAD LET ME IN FOR ALL THIS DISGUSTINGNESS GRANDMOTHER KEPT SAYING HOW THANKFUL WE OUGHT TO BE THAT I HAD BEEN THERE INSTEAD OF ANTONIA BUT I LAY WITH MY DISFIGURED FACE TO THE WALL AND FELT NO PARTICULAR GRATITUDE
1926-147987-0018 IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
1926-147987-0019 AND HAD LEFT AGAIN ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR DENVER THAT MORNING THE AGENT SAID HIS FACE WAS STRIPED WITH COURT PLASTER AND HE CARRIED HIS LEFT HAND IN A SLING HE LOOKED SO USED UP THAT THE AGENT ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE
1926-147987-0020 MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
1926-147987-0021 THERE STOOD MISSUS CUTTER LOCKED OUT FOR SHE HAD NO KEY TO THE NEW LOCK HER HEAD TREMBLING WITH RAGE I ADVISED HER TO CONTROL HERSELF OR SHE WOULD HAVE A STROKE GRANDMOTHER SAID AFTERWARDS
1926-147987-0022 ANTONIA WAS FRIGHTENED AND WAS GOING HOME TO STAY FOR A WHILE SHE TOLD MISSUS CUTTER IT WOULD BE USELESS TO INTERROGATE THE GIRL FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MISSUS CUTTER TOLD HER STORY
1926-147987-0023 SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD STARTED HOME FROM OMAHA TOGETHER THE MORNING BEFORE THEY HAD TO STOP OVER SEVERAL HOURS AT WAYMORE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN
1926-147987-0024 WHEN HE RETURNED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT THERE
1926-147987-0025 SHE SAW HIM SLIP A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL INTO HER HANDBAG WITH HER TICKET THAT BILL SHE SAID SHOULD HAVE AROUSED HER SUSPICIONS AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THE TRAINS ARE NEVER CALLED AT LITTLE JUNCTION TOWNS EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN THEY COME IN
1926-147987-0026 MISTER CUTTER SHOWED HIS WIFE'S TICKET TO THE CONDUCTOR AND SETTLED HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE THE TRAIN MOVED OFF
1926-147987-0027 AND THAT CUTTER MUST HAVE PLANNED IT SO THE CONDUCTOR TOLD HER THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN WAS DUE AT WAYMORE TWELVE MINUTES AFTER THE KANSAS CITY TRAIN LEFT SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLAYED THIS TRICK IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO BLACK HAWK WITHOUT HER
1926-147987-0028 SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO ON TO KANSAS CITY AND TAKE THE FIRST FAST TRAIN FOR HOME CUTTER COULD HAVE GOT HOME A DAY EARLIER THAN HIS WIFE BY ANY ONE OF A DOZEN SIMPLER DEVICES HE COULD HAVE LEFT HER IN THE OMAHA HOTEL
1926-147987-0029 BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS PART OF HIS FUN TO OUTRAGE HER FEELINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MISTER CUTTER WILL PAY FOR THIS MISSUS BURDEN HE WILL PAY MISSUS CUTTER AVOUCHED NODDING HER HORSELIKE HEAD AND ROLLING HER EYES
1926-147987-0030 CERTAINLY CUTTER LIKED TO HAVE HIS WIFE THINK HIM A DEVIL IN SOME WAY HE DEPENDED UPON THE EXCITEMENT HE COULD AROUSE IN HER HYSTERICAL NATURE PERHAPS HE GOT THE FEELING OF BEING A RAKE MORE FROM HIS WIFE'S RAGE AND AMAZEMENT
1926-147987-0031 THAN FROM ANY EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN HIS ZEST IN DEBAUCHERY MIGHT WANE BUT NEVER MISSUS CUTTER'S BELIEF IN IT THE RECKONING WITH HIS WIFE AT THE END OF AN ESCAPADE WAS SOMETHING HE COUNTED ON
