1970-10594-0000 HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE I WAS WALKING AWAY WHEN A MAN TOUCHED ME SOME ONE HAD SEEN ME COME FROM THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE OF COURSE THIS MEANT DETENTION TILL THE CORONER SHOULD ARRIVE
1970-10594-0001 I QUARRELED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT FELT FORCED TO SUBMIT HAPPILY JUPP NOW CAME TO THE FRONT AND I WAS ABLE TO SEND HIM TO NEW YORK TO KEEP THAT WATCH OVER MISSUS CAREW WITHOUT WHICH I COULD NOT HAVE RESTED QUIET AN HOUR
1970-10594-0002 ONE GREAT ELEMENT OF DANGER WAS REMOVED MOST REMARKABLY IF NOT PROVIDENTIALLY FROM THE PATH I HAD MARKED OUT FOR MYSELF BUT THERE STILL REMAINED THAT OF THIS WOMAN'S POSSIBLE IMPULSES
1970-10594-0003 UNDER HER GREAT DETERMINATION TO KEEP GWENDOLEN IN HER OWN CARE BUT WITH JUPP TO WATCH THE DOCK AND A MAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES AT THE DOOR OF THE SMALL HOTEL SHE WAS AT PRESENT BOUND FOR I THOUGHT I MIGHT REMAIN IN YONKERS CONTENTEDLY THE WHOLE DAY
1970-10594-0004 MISSUS CAREW AND THE CHILD WERE STILL AT THE ADDRESS SHE HAD GIVEN ME ALL LOOKED WELL IN THAT DIRECTION
1970-10594-0005 MISS PORTER WHO CAME IN HASTE TO GREET ME WORE THE CAREWORN LOOK OF A LONG AND UNRELIEVED VIGIL
1970-10594-0006 HOW COULD I SHE ASKED WHEN MISSUS OCUMPAUGH DID NOT CLOSE HER EYES SHE DID NOT EVEN LIE DOWN BUT SAT ALL NIGHT IN AN ARM CHAIR WHICH SHE HAD WHEELED INTO GWENDOLEN'S ROOM
1970-10594-0007 STARING LIKE ONE WHO SEES NOTHING OUT INTO THE NIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH OVERLOOKS THE RIVER THIS MORNING WE CAN NOT MAKE HER SPEAK HER EYES ARE DRY WITH FEVER ONLY NOW AND THEN SHE UTTERS A LITTLE MOAN
1970-10594-0008 THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE HER HUSBAND UNLESS SOMETHING COMES TO ROUSE HER BUT THE PAPERS GIVE NO NEWS AND ALL THE ATTEMPTS OF THE POLICE END IN NOTHING
1970-10594-0009 YOU SAW WHAT A DISMAL FAILURE THEIR LAST ATTEMPT WAS THE CHILD ON WHICH THEY COUNTED PROVED TO BE BOTH RED HAIRED AND POCK MARKED GWENDOLEN APPEARS TO BE LOST LOST
1970-10594-0010 IN SPITE OF THE DESPAIR THUS EXPRESSED MY WAY SEEMED TO OPEN A LITTLE I THINK I CAN BREAK MISSUS OCUMPAUGH'S DANGEROUS APATHY IF YOU WILL LET ME SEE HER AGAIN WILL YOU LET ME TRY THE NURSE WE HAVE A NURSE NOW
1970-10594-0011 WILL NOT CONSENT I FEAR THEN TELEPHONE TO THE DOCTOR TELL HIM I AM THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN DO ANYTHING FOR MISSUS OCUMPAUGH THIS WILL NOT BE AN EXAGGERATION WAIT I WILL GET HIS ORDER
1970-10594-0012 I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOU IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE CAME TO LEAD ME TO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH I ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING THEY TOLD ME TO SHE WAS SEATED AS THEY SAID IN A LARGE CHAIR
1970-10594-0013 BUT WITH NO EASE TO HERSELF FOR SHE WAS NOT EVEN LEANING AGAINST ITS BACK
1970-10594-0014 WHERE FROM WHAT SHE HAD INTIMATED TO ME IN OUR LAST INTERVIEW
1970-10594-0015 THERE WAS A MINIATURE IN HER HAND BUT I SAW AT FIRST GLANCE THAT IT WAS NOT THE FACE OF GWENDOLEN OVER WHICH HER FINGERS CLOSED SO SPASMODICALLY IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WHICH SHE HELD
1970-10594-0016 AND IT WAS HIS FACE AROUSED AND FULL OF DENUNCIATION WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY SAW IN HER FANCY AS I DREW NEARER HER IN MY EFFORTS TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION FOR A SHIVER SUDDENLY CONTRACTED HER LOVELY FEATURES
1970-10594-0017 AND SHE THREW HER ARMS OUT AS IF TO WARD FROM HERSELF SOMETHING WHICH SHE HAD NO POWER TO MEET IN DOING THIS HER HEAD TURNED SLIGHTLY AND SHE SAW ME INSTANTLY THE SPELL UNDER WHICH SHE SAT FROZEN
1970-10594-0018 YIELDED TO A RECOGNITION OF SOMETHING BESIDES HER OWN TERRIBLE BROODING SHE LET HER ARMS DROP AND THE LIPS WHICH HAD NOT SPOKEN THAT MORNING MOVED SLIGHTLY I WAITED RESPECTFULLY
1970-10594-0019 I SAW THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WOULD SPEAK YOU HAVE COME SHE PANTED OUT AT LAST TO HEAR MY DECISION IT IS TOO SOON THE STEAMER HAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS YET BEFORE IT CAN MAKE PORT
1970-10594-0020 I HAVE NOT FINISHED WEIGHING MY LIFE AGAINST THE GOOD OPINION OF HIM I LIVE FOR THEN FAINTLY MISSUS CAREW HAS GONE TO NEW YORK I FINISHED NO FARTHER THAN THAT
1970-10594-0021 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY SHE HAS NOT SAILED I DID NOT SEE HOW IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH MY DUTY TO LET HER MISSUS OCUMPAUGH'S WHOLE FORM COLLAPSED THE DANGEROUS APATHY WAS CREEPING OVER HER AGAIN
1970-10594-0022 YOU ARE DECIDING FOR ME SHE SPOKE VERY FAINTLY YOU AND DOCTOR POOL
1970-10594-0023 NO NOT YET I WANTED HER TO CHOOSE THE NOBLE COURSE FOR MISTER OCUMPAUGH'S SAKE YES AND FOR HER OWN NO I VENTURED TO REJOIN YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SETTLE YOUR OWN FATE
1970-10594-0024 THE WORD MUST COME FROM YOU I AM ONLY TRYING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR HUSBAND WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL WRONG TO BLUNT HIS POSSIBLE FORGIVENESS OH HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE
1970-10594-0025 AND I HAVE LOST ALL AND THE SET LOOK RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
1970-10594-0026 MISSUS OCUMPAUGH WE MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT TOGETHER IN CONFIDENCE THERE IS ONE THING I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU SOMETHING WHICH I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW AS IT MAY AFFECT YOUR WHOLE FUTURE COURSE
1970-10594-0027 IT CONCERNS GWENDOLEN'S REAL MOTHER YOU SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW HER NO
1970-10594-0028 MY DARLING IS HAPPY WITH MISSUS CAREW TOO HAPPY
1970-10594-0029 ALARMED I PUT OUT MY HAND IN A SOOTHING GESTURE
1970-10594-0030 I MADE HASTE TO SAY LISTEN TO MY LITTLE STORY IT WILL NOT ADD TO YOUR PAIN RATHER ALLEVIATE IT
1970-10594-0031 I ALSO KNEW THAT THIS PATIENT HAD OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL AS I FOR IMPERVIOUS AS THE DOOR LOOKED I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE DOCTOR'S MUTTERINGS WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS SAFE BEYOND EAR SHOT IF NOT ASLEEP
1970-10594-0032 YES SHE WAS READY TO MAKE HER COMPACT WITH THE DOCTOR JUST AS YOU HAD DONE BEFORE SHE LEFT EVERYTHING WAS ARRANGED FOR IT WAS HER CHILD YOU TOOK REARED LOVED AND HAVE NOW LOST
1970-10594-0033 AT ANOTHER TIME SHE MIGHT HAVE RESENTED THESE WORDS ESPECIALLY THE LAST BUT I HAD ROUSED HER CURIOSITY HER PANTING EAGER CURIOSITY AND SHE LET THEM PASS ALTOGETHER UNCHALLENGED DID YOU SEE THIS WOMAN
1970-10594-0034 WAS SHE OF COMMON BLOOD COMMON MANNERS IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE GWENDOLEN IS BY NATURE SO DAINTY IN ALL HER WAYS THE WOMAN WAS A LADY I DID NOT SEE HER FACE IT WAS HEAVILY VEILED
1970-10594-0035 BUT I HEARD HER VOICE IT WAS A LADY'S VOICE AND WHAT SHE WORE BEAUTIFUL JEWELS JEWELS YOU SAID SHE WAS POOR SO SHE DECLARED HERSELF BUT SHE HAD ON HER NECK UNDER HER COAT
1970-10594-0036 A STRING OF BEADS WHICH WERE BOTH VALUABLE AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP I KNOW BECAUSE IT BROKE JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING AND THE BEADS FELL ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND ONE ROLLED MY WAY AND I PICKED IT UP SCAMP THAT I WAS
1970-10594-0037 WHEN BOTH THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE OTHERS A BEAD A COSTLY BEAD AND YOU WERE NOT FOUND OUT NO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH SHE NEVER SEEMED TO MISS IT
1970-10594-0038 TO COUNT CORRECTLY SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD THEM ALL BUT THIS HAS BEEN IN MY POCKET FOR SIX YEARS PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN ITS LIKE
1970-10594-0039 TILL YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HER GREAT EYES HAGGARD WITH SUFFERING ROSE TO MINE THEN THEY FELL ON THE BEAD WHICH I HAD TAKEN FROM MY POCKET THE CRY SHE GAVE WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT EFFECTUALLY SETTLED ALL MY DOUBTS
1970-10594-0040 I ASKED IMPRESSIVELY FOR MINUTES SHE DID NOT ANSWER SHE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF HER MOTHER SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST HER MOTHER HER OWN MOTHER
1970-10594-0041 AND SHE NEVER HINTED IT TO ME BY WORD OR LOOK OH VALERIE VALERIE WHAT TORTURES WE HAVE BOTH SUFFERED AND NOW YOU ARE HAPPY WHILE I GRIEF SEEMED TO ENGULF HER
1970-10594-0042 FEELING MY POSITION KEENLY I WALKED TO THE WINDOW BUT SOON TURNED AND CAME BACK IN RESPONSE TO HER CRY I MUST SEE MISSUS CAREW INSTANTLY
