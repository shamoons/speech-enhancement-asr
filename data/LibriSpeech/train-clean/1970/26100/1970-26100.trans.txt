1970-26100-0000 HER WILLINGNESS TO BREAK OUR FRIENDSHIP AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY GAVE ME LITTLE ROOM TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT SHE SHOULD RISK HER REPUTATION TO RUN AFTER THAT MAN WAS INEXPLICABLE BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A WOMAN
1970-26100-0001 IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
1970-26100-0002 AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME AN AWFULLY GOOD REASON FOR HER SUDDEN INTEREST IN FRANK WOODS BEFORE I WOULD FORGIVE HER THESE THOUGHTS HELD MY ATTENTION ALL THE WAY OUT
1970-26100-0003 NOW AND AGAIN I WOULD BE RECALLED FROM MY GLOOM BY SOME QUESTION FROM THE CORONER HE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHO MURDERED JIM
1970-26100-0004 AS WE NEARED THE BRIDGE I NOTICED AGAIN HOW SCANT THE VEGETATION WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD ANY ONE WISHING TO MURDER JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM COMING
1970-26100-0005 COULD BE SEEN THE THIRTEENTH HOLE OF THE COUNTRY CLUB GOLF LINKS WHEN WE REACHED THE CREST OF THE HILL LEADING DOWN TO THE BRIDGE OUR EYES AT ONCE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A TALL MAPLE TREE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM IT
1970-26100-0006 AS HE SAW IT THE CORONER GAVE A GRUNT OF SATISFACTION THERE'S OUR TREE WE STOPPED THE CAR AND SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE THORNY BUSHES THAT LINED THE ROAD THE GROUND WAS HARD CLAY WITH ONLY BURDOCK AND WEEDS GROWING ON IT
1970-26100-0007 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WHEN WE REACHED THE TREE THE CORONER EXAMINED THE GROUND AROUND IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE AROSE HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND HERE I ASKED
1970-26100-0008 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT FIND IF THE MAN WHO FIRED THOSE SHOTS USED THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE MIGHT FIND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE OR TWO THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST SOME BROKEN TWIGS OR SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS UP THERE BUT I FIND NOTHING AT ALL
1970-26100-0009 STILL THE FACT THAT THE TREE IS WHERE IT IS MAKES THE THEORY PLAUSIBLE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE ROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES
1970-26100-0010 THOSE BULLET HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WERE FIRED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND THE MACHINE THEY SLANTED DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWISE
1970-26100-0011 BUT IF THE MURDERER USED THIS TREE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE STARTED FIRING BEFORE THE CAR CAME OPPOSITE
1970-26100-0012 I'M SORRY FOR WHEN I SAW THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE'D STRUCK THE RIGHT TRACK THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T MAKE OUT I STATED AND THAT IS THE STRANGE CRY OF MY SISTER IN HER DELIRIUM LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US SHE CALLED OUT
1970-26100-0013 AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SWEAR IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE CORONER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN TURNED TO ME WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO REFER TO THE ACCIDENT ALL THE REST WAS APPARENTLY DELIRIUM
1970-26100-0014 SHE BEGGED FORGIVENESS FOR SOME FANCIED WRONG AND REPEATED THAT A CERTAIN MAN WAS NOT GUILTY OF DISHONESTY BUT HER FIRST WEIRD CRY HAD TO DO WITH THE MURDER I'M SURE
1970-26100-0015 EVERYTHING POINTS TO AN AEROPLANE IT WAS DONE A HUNDRED YES A THOUSAND TIMES IN THE WAR WHILE I WAS OVER THERE WITH MY HOSPITAL UNIT WE USED TO GET A LOT OF CASES OF MOTORCYCLE DESPATCH RIDERS WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF BY GERMAN AVIATORS
1970-26100-0016 AND IS THE HEAD OF AN AEROPLANE FIRM BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN AEROPLANE HERE HE COULD GET ONE EASY ENOUGH THE CLEVER DEVIL LOOK OVER THERE HE HAD THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE GOLF COURSE AS A PERFECT LANDING GROUND
1970-26100-0017 HELPLESS BEFORE APPROACHING DEATH I COULD IMAGINE HELEN'S AGONY AS SHE SAW THAT DIM BLACK SHAPE
1970-26100-0018 LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US YES BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE IT I ASKED THAT'S UP TO US NOW AN AEROPLANE HAS SUCH SPEED THAT IT WAS EASY FOR WOODS TO FASHION AN INGENIOUS ALIBI
1970-26100-0019 TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF HIS TIME ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER BUT THERE MUST BE SOME HOLES IN IT THERE ALWAYS IS IN A MANUFACTURED ALIBI I WANT YOU TO GO OVER TO THE COUNTRY CLUB AND CHECK UP MISTER WOODS SCHEDULE OF THAT NIGHT
1970-26100-0020 WHILE I EXAMINE THE GOLF LINKS TO SEE IF HE LANDED THERE WE JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND DROVE RAPIDLY TO THE CLUB I WENT INTO THE HOUSE BY THE BACK WAY TO AVOID MEETING PEOPLE AND ASKED FOR JACKSON
1970-26100-0021 JACKSON WHAT TIME DID MISTER WOODS GET OUT HERE ON THE EVENING MISTER FELDERSON WAS KILLED
1970-26100-0022 DID YOU SEE HIM AT THAT TIME

1970-26100-0025 I ASKED THE BOY WAS TREMBLING HE ROLLED FRIGHTENED EYES TOWARD JACKSON WHO WAS GLARING AT HIM FINALLY HE BROKE INTO A WAIL
1970-26100-0026 MOTIONING THE ANGRY JACKSON AWAY HE HE SET DOWN AT DE TABLE BUT HE AIN'T EAT NONE THE BOY STUTTERED WHAT DO YOU MEAN GEORGE
1970-26100-0027 AH BRUNG HIM SOME SOUP BUT HE GOT UP POWFUL SUDDEN LAK HE HAD A CALL TO DE TELEPHOME AN HE AIN'T COME BACK ARE YOU SURE OF THAT GEORGE YAS SUH

1970-26100-0029 I GAVE THE BOY A DOLLAR AND HE WENT AWAY HAPPY JACKSON HAD A SHEEPISH LOOK ON HIS FACE THEN MISTER WOODS WASN'T HERE ALL THROUGH DINNER JACKSON DRAT DAT BOY

1970-26100-0031 GROGAN DO YOU REMEMBER WHO WAS IN THE BAR BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND EIGHT THIRTY ON THE NIGHT OF THE FELDERSON MURDER ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE GENTLEMEN SIR THERE WAS MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN AND I THINK MISTER WOODS
1970-26100-0032 ARE YOU SURE MISTER WOODS WAS IN HERE WELL NO SIR NOT EXACTLY I REMEMBER MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME OTHERS THE REASON I THINK MISTER WOODS WAS HERE
1970-26100-0033 WAS BECAUSE HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT A FEW NIGHTS AFTER THE MURDER THERE WERE A FEW GENTLEMEN IN HERE AND THEY WERE TALKING OF MISTER FELDERSON'S DEATH MISTER WOODS SAID IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE MURDERER HADN'T BEEN FOUND
1970-26100-0034 ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
1970-26100-0035 OH HIS ALIBI IS GOOD OF COURSE BECAUSE HE WAS AROUND THE CLUB ALL THAT EVENING I GUESS HE WAS HERE AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND LEFT FAR OUT ON THE GOLF LINKS THE CORONER WAS BENDING OVER EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
1970-26100-0036 PARALLELING EACH OTHER FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YARDS
