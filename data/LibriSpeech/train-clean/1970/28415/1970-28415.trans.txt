1970-28415-0000 THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
1970-28415-0001 JESUS GOT ON THE DONKEY AND STARTED FOR JERUSALEM THE DISCIPLES WALKED AHEAD WHEN THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE CITY THE DISCIPLES BEGAN TO SHOUT JESUS USED TO SAY THAT THEY MUST NOT TELL ANYONE THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
1970-28415-0004 HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH TRAVELERS FROM ALL OVER PALESTINE AND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOO THEY WERE THE PILGRIMS WHO HAD COME FOR THE PASSOVER FEAST THE CROWDS SAW THE PROCESSION COMING THEY SAW THE DONKEY
1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
1970-28415-0006 SOME CUT BRANCHES FROM THE TREES AND WAVED THEM BEFORE THE MESSIAH IT WAS A ROYAL WELCOME ONLY THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS AND THE PHARISEES WERE SORRY TO SEE JESUS COME WHAT IS THERE WE CAN DO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
1970-28415-0007 WHO IS THIS THEY ASKED OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM ANSWERED WHY THIS IS JESUS THE PROPHET FROM NAZARETH IN GALILEE
1970-28415-0008 THIS WAS HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HIS HOUSE THESE WERE HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE AND HIS PEOPLE THE KING FOR WHOM THE JEWS HAD BEEN WAITING HAD COME AT LAST TO REIGN
1970-28415-0009 THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
1970-28415-0010 OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS
1970-28415-0011 WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
1970-28415-0012 BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAID
1970-28415-0013 WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO DO THESE THINGS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD ACT LIKE THIS SO FAR JESUS HAD NEVER SAID THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0014 BUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT
1970-28415-0015 THEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACH
1970-28415-0016 NEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIM
1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
1970-28415-0019 THERE WAS A MAN'S PICTURE STAMPED ON ONE SIDE OF IT JESUS SAID WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT WHY THEY ANSWERED THAT IS A PICTURE OF CAESAR THE EMPEROR OF ROME ALL RIGHT SAID JESUS
1970-28415-0020 DO WHATEVER YOUR DUTY IS TO CAESAR AND HIS GOVERNMENT YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES AND ALSO DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER ANSWER THAT NO ONE HAD A WORD TO SAY
1970-28415-0021 WATCH OUT FOR THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES HE TOLD THE PEOPLE AND DON'T BE LIKE THEM THEY LOVE TO WALK AROUND IN THEIR LONG WHITE ROBES AND TO HAVE EVERYBODY BOW TO THEM IN THE STREET AND TO SIT IN THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND AT DINNERS
1970-28415-0022 WHICH PEOPLE WALK OVER WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IS UNDERNEATH NOBODY KNOWS HOW BAD YOU ARE YOU SNAKES HOW CAN YOU ESCAPE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH GOD IS BRINGING UPON YOU HE LEFT THE PHARISEES AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE
1970-28415-0023 WHERE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THEIR GIFTS TO GOD
1970-28415-0024 THEN CAME A POOR WIDOW WHO PUT TWO SMALL COINS INTO THE BOX JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE GIVING
1970-28415-0025 AND IT DOESN'T COST THEM ANYTHING TO GIVE WHAT THEY DO BUT THIS POOR WOMAN NEEDS HER MONEY AND SHE HAS GIVEN ALL SHE HAS WITH MANY WORDS AND STORIES HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE WHO THRONGED AROUND HIM ON THE DAYS OF THAT WEEK
1970-28415-0026 AND THIS WAS THE LAST STORY HE EVER TOLD SOMEDAY I SHALL SIT UPON MY THRONE AND JUDGE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH TO SOME PEOPLE I WILL SAY COME MY HEAVENLY FATHER LOVES YOU
1970-28415-0027 TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
1970-28415-0028 I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR AND YOU GAVE ME CLOTHES I WAS SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO VISIT ME THEN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY LORD WHEN DID WE EVER DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
1970-28415-0029 THEN I WILL SAY TO OTHERS GO AWAY GOD WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND NAKED AND SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU DID NOTHING AT ALL FOR ME
1970-28415-0030 THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
1970-28415-0031 IF WE HAD SEEN YOU NEEDING ANYTHING WE WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU AND I WILL SAY MANY POOR PEOPLE NEEDED YOUR HELP AND YOU DID NOT HELP THEM WHEN YOU FAILED THEM YOU FAILED ME AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE
1970-28415-0032 IF HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN JERUSALEM PRETENDING TO BE KING OF THE JEWS THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS WANTED TO KILL JESUS THAT WAS ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
1970-28415-0033 FOR WHENEVER JESUS CAME TO JERUSALEM GREAT CROWDS GATHERED AROUND HIM NONE OF THE PRIESTS DARED TO LAY A FINGER ON HIM IN THE OPEN THE CROWDS WOULD NEVER LET THEM IT SEEMED TO THE PEOPLE AS IF THE MESSIAH MIGHT HAVE COME AT LAST
1970-28415-0034 BUT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS SAID THE WEEK WAS GOING BY
1970-28415-0035 WE SHALL HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH JESUS QUIETLY SOMEONE SAID YES THE OTHERS AGREED WE CAN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY OF THE PASSOVER IF WE SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO HIM ON THAT DAY THERE WOULD BE A RIOT
1970-28415-0036 THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF JESUS THE CRAFTIEST MEN IN JERUSALEM COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR IT WAS ONE OF JESUS TWELVE DISCIPLES
