198-129977-0000 ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0003 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
198-129977-0004 AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0006 WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
198-129977-0007 WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
198-129977-0008 THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
198-129977-0009 I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0012 IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
198-129977-0013 BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
198-129977-0014 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0015 I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
198-129977-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0018 BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
198-129977-0019 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0020 THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
198-129977-0021 SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
198-129977-0022 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0024 THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
198-129977-0025 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-129977-0027 MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
198-129977-0028 WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
198-129977-0029 AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
198-129977-0030 EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
198-129977-0031 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-129977-0032 HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
