2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0004 THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0007 WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0010 WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0013 THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0016 OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0019 HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0022 BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0025 AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0028 WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0031 HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0034 THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0037 BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0040 WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0043 WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0046 QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0049 AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0052 ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0055 NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0058 IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0061 LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0064 ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0067 FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0070 AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0076 THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0079 WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0082 WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0085 AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0088 WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0091 AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0094 WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
2002-139469-0096 OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
2002-139469-0097 WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0103 IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
2002-139469-0106 TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0109 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0112 CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
2002-139469-0114 MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
2002-139469-0115 VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
