2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0011 COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0014 BUT IT IS EXPECTED BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW AND I SHALL KNOW THEN PERHAPS EMILY ENQUIRED IF SHE HAD EVER HEARD THE SERVANTS TALK OF PRISONERS AH MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE ARCHLY
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0017 MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0020 AND ARE YOU INDEED SO SIMPLE ANNETTE SAID EMILY SMILING AT THIS CURIOUS EXAGGERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAD WITNESSED AS TO CREDIT THESE STORIES CREDIT THEM MA'AMSELLE WHY
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0023 BUT WILL FALL TO CUTTING AND SLASHING TILL HE MAKES THEM ALL RISE UP DEAD MEN NO NO SAYS I THERE IS REASON IN ALL THINGS
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0026 BUT I DARE SAY HE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR CALLING IT SO THAN YOU HAVE MA'AM EMILY LOOKED DISPLEASED AND MADE NO REPLY AS SHE MUSED UPON THE RECOLLECTED APPEARANCE WHICH HAD LATELY SO MUCH ALARMED HER AND CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIGURE HAVING STATIONED ITSELF
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0029 WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0032 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0035 AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0038 WHICH SHE OBEYED WITH TREMBLING AND ON HER WAY THITHER ENDEAVOURED TO ANIMATE HER FORTITUDE WITH THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT MONTONI WAS ALONE I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RETRACTING YOUR LATE MISTAKEN ASSERTIONS
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0041 I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0044 FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0047 YOU HAVE DARED TO QUESTION MY RIGHT NOW DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER I HAVE A PUNISHMENT WHICH YOU THINK NOT OF IT IS TERRIBLE THIS NIGHT THIS VERY NIGHT' THIS
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0050 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0053 I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHEN ONCE MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN BUT I AM TALKING TO A BABY LET ME HOWEVER REPEAT THAT TERRIBLE AS ARE THE EXAMPLES I COULD RECITE THE RECITAL COULD NOT NOW BENEFIT YOU
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0056 QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0059 BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING ALOUD TO HIS SERVANTS TO SEARCH THE CHAMBER AS HE HAD FORMERLY DONE ON A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE PASSED TO THE RAMPARTS AS IN HER WAY TO THE CORRIDOR SHE RESTED FOR A MOMENT AT AN OPEN CASEMENT EMILY SAW A PARTY OF MONTONI'S TROOPS WINDING DOWN A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
