2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S

2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN

2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL

2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A
