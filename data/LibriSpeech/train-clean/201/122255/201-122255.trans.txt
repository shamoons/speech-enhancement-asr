201-122255-0000 THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
201-122255-0001 AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
201-122255-0002 AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
201-122255-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0004 FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
201-122255-0005 FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
201-122255-0006 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0007 AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
201-122255-0008 BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
201-122255-0009 SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
201-122255-0010 THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
201-122255-0011 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0012 MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
201-122255-0013 ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
201-122255-0014 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
201-122255-0016 QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
201-122255-0017 BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
201-122255-0018 LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
