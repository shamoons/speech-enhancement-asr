211-122425-0000 DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0001 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0003 WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
211-122425-0004 AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0005 THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
211-122425-0006 LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
211-122425-0007 AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
211-122425-0008 YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
211-122425-0009 AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
211-122425-0010 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0012 BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
211-122425-0013 THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
211-122425-0014 ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
211-122425-0015 BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
211-122425-0016 YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
211-122425-0017 AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
211-122425-0018 ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
211-122425-0019 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0021 HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
211-122425-0022 THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0023 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0024 HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
211-122425-0025 IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
211-122425-0026 IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
211-122425-0027 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
211-122425-0028 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0029 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122425-0030 D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
211-122425-0031 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0032 ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
211-122425-0033 AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
211-122425-0034 PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0036 DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
211-122425-0037 LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
211-122425-0038 YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
211-122425-0039 LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
211-122425-0040 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0041 WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
211-122425-0042 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122425-0043 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0044 HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
211-122425-0045 AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
211-122425-0046 IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
211-122425-0047 AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
211-122425-0048 AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0049 AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
211-122425-0050 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0051 TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0052 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0054 EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
211-122425-0055 DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
211-122425-0056 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0057 WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
211-122425-0058 AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0059 AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
211-122425-0060 DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
211-122425-0061 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0062 THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0063 GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
211-122425-0064 EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
211-122425-0065 WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0066 WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
211-122425-0067 BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
211-122425-0068 HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
211-122425-0069 WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
211-122425-0070 AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0071 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0072 IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
211-122425-0073 OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
211-122425-0074 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0075 LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
211-122425-0076 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122425-0078 RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
211-122425-0079 THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
211-122425-0080 NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
211-122425-0081 HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
