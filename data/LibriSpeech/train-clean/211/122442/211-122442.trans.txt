211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0002 WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
211-122442-0003 BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
211-122442-0004 I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
211-122442-0005 IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
211-122442-0006 THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
211-122442-0007 THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
211-122442-0011 EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
211-122442-0012 MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
211-122442-0014 AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS

211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
211-122442-0025 D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
