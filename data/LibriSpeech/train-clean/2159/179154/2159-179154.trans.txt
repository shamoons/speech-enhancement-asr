2159-179154-0000 COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
2159-179154-0001 THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
2159-179154-0002 IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
2159-179154-0003 WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
2159-179154-0004 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0005 WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
2159-179154-0006 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0007 AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
2159-179154-0008 THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
2159-179154-0009 THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
2159-179154-0010 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0011 HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
2159-179154-0012 THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0015 PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
2159-179154-0016 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
2159-179154-0018 JUST AS HE WAS RETURNING IT TO HIS POCKET THE LADY SUDDENLY POINTED A FINGER AT HIM
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0021 ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A BROOMSTICK AND TOLD TO HUNT GAME IN THE WOODS BEFORE HIM ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A LARGE RAG DOLL AND TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INFANT AND THAT HE MUST LOOK AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND DISCOVER THE FATHER
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0023 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0024 AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
2159-179154-0025 THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
2159-179154-0026 AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
2159-179154-0027 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0028 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0030 HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
2159-179154-0031 AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
2159-179154-0032 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0033 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0035 HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
2159-179154-0036 THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
2159-179154-0037 WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
2159-179154-0038 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179154-0039 HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
