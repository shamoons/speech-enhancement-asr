2182-150130-0000 THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
2182-150130-0001 THE OTHER LADS WERE SOMETIMES OCCUPIED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WHEN SPORTS WERE AFOOT IN WHICH THEY WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TAKEN PART MYLES WAS ALWAYS FREE TO ENTER INTO ANY MATTER OF THE KIND AFTER HIS DAILY EXERCISE HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT THE PELS THE BUTTS OR THE TILTING COURT
2182-150130-0002 THE LADY ANNE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A TALL THIN DARK EYED DARK HAIRED HANDSOME YOUNG DAME OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAWK NOSED LIKE HER FATHER AND SILENT PROUD AND HAUGHTY MYLES HEARD THE SQUIRES SAY
2182-150130-0003 LADY ALICE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH'S NIECE AND WARD A GREAT HEIRESS IN HER OWN RIGHT A STRIKINGLY PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THESE COMPOSED THE EARL'S PERSONAL FAMILY
2182-150130-0004 BUT BESIDES THEM WAS LORD GEORGE BEAUMONT HIS EARL'S BROTHER AND HIM MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BETTER THAN ANY OF THE CHIEF PEOPLE OF THE CASTLE EXCEPTING SIR JAMES LEE FOR SINCE MYLES'S GREAT BATTLE IN THE ARMORY LORD GEORGE
2182-150130-0005 FOR THE PRINCELY NOBLES OF THOSE DAYS LIVED IN STATE LITTLE LESS ROYAL THAN ROYALTY ITSELF MOST OF THE KNIGHTS AND GENTLEMEN MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BY SIGHT MEETING THEM IN LORD GEORGE'S APARTMENTS IN THE SOUTH WING OF THE GREAT HOUSE
2182-150130-0006 AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
2182-150130-0007 ALL OF US AS WE GROW OLDER HAVE IN OUR MEMORY PICTURES OF BY GONE TIMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE THAN USUALLY VIVID THE COLORS OF SOME NOT BLURRING BY TIME AS OTHERS DO
2182-150130-0008 ONE OF WHICH IN REMEMBERING ALWAYS FILLED MYLES'S HEART IN AFTER YEARS WITH AN INDEFINABLE PLEASURE WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF STANDING WITH OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW SQUIRES
2182-150130-0009 WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
2182-150130-0010 SHOT IN THEIR SOUTHWARD FLIGHT BY THE LADS AND COOKED BY FAT GOOD NATURED MOTHER JOAN GRACED THE RUDE MESS TABLE OF THE SQUIRES IN THE LONG HALL AND EVEN THE TOUGHEST AND FISHIEST DRAKE SO THE FRUIT OF THEIR SKILL HAD A SAVOR THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
2182-150130-0011 THE DAINTIEST FARE LACKED IN AFTER YEARS THEN FALL PASSED AND WINTER CAME BLEAK COLD AND DREARY NOT WINTER AS WE KNOW IT NOWADAYS WITH WARM FIRES AND BRIGHT LIGHTS TO MAKE THE LONG NIGHTS SWEET AND CHEERFUL WITH COMFORT
2182-150130-0012 BUT WINTER WITH ALL ITS GRIMNESS AND STERNNESS IN THE GREAT COLD STONE WALLED CASTLES OF THOSE DAYS THE ONLY FIRE AND ALMOST THE ONLY LIGHT WERE THOSE FROM THE HUGE BLAZING LOGS THAT ROARED AND CRACKLED IN THE GREAT OPEN STONE FIREPLACE
2182-150130-0013 AROUND WHICH THE FOLKS GATHERED SHELTERING THEIR FACES AS BEST THEY COULD FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT AND CLOAKING THEIR SHOULDERS FROM THE BITING COLD FOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE GIANT SHADOWS SWAYED AND BOWED AND DANCED HUGE AND BLACK AGAINST THE HIGH WALLS
2182-150130-0014 BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
2182-150130-0015 YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
2182-150130-0016 WHEN THE SODDEN SNOW IS FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO MAKE SNOWBALLS OF THRICE THAT BITTER WINTER THE MOAT WAS FROZEN OVER AND THE LADS MAKING THEMSELVES SKATES OF MARROW BONES WHICH THEY BOUGHT FROM THE HALL COOK AT A GROAT A PAIR WENT SKIMMING OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE
2182-150130-0017 WHILE THE CROWS AND THE JACKDAWS LOOKED DOWN AT THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE BLEAK GRAY WALLS THEN AT YULE TIDE WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT OF A RUDE SEMBLANCE TO THE MERRY CHRISTMAS SEASON OF OUR DAY A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD IN THE HALL
2182-150130-0018 AND ALL THE CASTLE FOLK WERE FED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS OXEN AND SHEEP WERE ROASTED WHOLE HUGE SUET PUDDINGS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND STUFFED WITH PLUMS WERE BOILED IN GREAT CALDRONS IN THE OPEN COURTYARD
2182-150130-0019 WHOLE BARRELS OF ALE AND MALMSEY WERE BROACHED AND ALL THE FOLK GENTLE AND SIMPLE WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AFTERWARDS THE MINSTRELS DANCED AND PLAYED A RUDE PLAY AND IN THE EVENING A MIRACLE SHOW WAS PERFORMED ON A RAISED PLATFORM IN THE NORTH HALL
2182-150130-0020 FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
2182-150130-0021 AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
2182-150130-0022 WHEN THE BUDS SWELLED AND THE LEAVES BURST FORTH ONCE MORE AND CROCUSES AND THEN DAFFODILS GLEAMED IN THE GREEN GRASS LIKE SPARKS AND FLAMES OF GOLD WITH THE SPRING CAME THE OUT DOOR SPORTS OF THE SEASON AMONG OTHERS THAT OF BALL
2182-150130-0023 FOR BOYS WERE BOYS AND PLAYED AT BALL EVEN IN THOSE FARAWAY DAYS A GAME CALLED TRAP BALL EVEN YET IN SOME PARTS OF ENGLAND IT IS PLAYED JUST AS IT WAS IN MYLES FALWORTH'S DAY AND ENJOYED JUST AS MYLES AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED IT
2182-150130-0024 SO NOW THAT THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WEATHER PLEASANT THE GAME OF TRAP BALL WAS IN FULL SWING EVERY AFTERNOON THE PLAY GROUND BEING AN OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CASTLE GROUNDS AND THAT OF THE PRIVY GARDEN
2182-150130-0025 MYLES HIMSELF WAS AT THE TRAP BAREHANDED AND BAREARMED THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM BEHIND HIM AND AIDED PERHAPS BY IT HE HAD ALREADY STRUCK THREE OF FOUR BALLS NEARLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE COURT AN UNUSUAL DISTANCE
2182-150130-0026 AND SEVERAL OF THE LADS HAD GONE BACK ALMOST AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE PRIVY GARDEN TO CATCH ANY BALL THAT MIGHT CHANCE TO FLY AS FAR AS THAT THEN ONCE MORE MYLES STRUCK THROWING ALL HIS STRENGTH INTO THE BLOW THE BALL SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
2182-150130-0027 AND WHEN IT FELL IT WAS TO DROP WITHIN THE PRIVY GARDEN THE SHOUTS OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS WERE INSTANTLY STILLED AND GASCOYNE WHO STOOD NEAREST MYLES THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BELT GIVING A LONG SHRILL WHISTLE
2182-150130-0028 THERE BE NO MORE PLAY FOR US UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER BALL THE OUTFIELDERS CAME SLOWLY TROOPING IN UNTIL THEY HAD GATHERED IN A LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES I COULD NOT HELP IT SAID MYLES IN ANSWER TO THEIR GRUMBLING HOW KNEW I THE BALL WOULD FLY SO FAR
2182-150130-0029 WOULDST GET THYSELF SHOT WITH A BOLT BETWIXT THE RIBS LIKE POOR DICCON COOK OF ALL PLACES ABOUT THE CASTLE THE PRIVY GARDEN WAS PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED IT WAS A SMALL PLOT OF GROUND ONLY A FEW RODS LONG AND WIDE
2182-150130-0030 AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE COUNTESS AND HER FAMILY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE MYLES HAD FIRST COME TO DEVLEN ONE OF THE COOK'S MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CLIMBING THE WALL WHEREUPON THE SOLDIER WHO SAW HIM SHOT HIM WITH HIS CROSS BOW
2182-150130-0031 THE POOR FELLOW DROPPED FROM THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM HE STILL HELD A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HIS HAND WHICH HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN GATHERING FOR HIS SWEETHEART HAD MYLES SEEN HIM CARRIED ON A LITTER TO THE INFIRMARY AS GASCOYNE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS HAD DONE
2182-150130-0032 HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE VENTURING TO ENTER THE LADIES PRIVATE GARDEN AS IT WAS HE ONLY SHOOK HIS STUBBORN HEAD AND SAID AGAIN I WILL CLIMB THE WALL AND FETCH IT
2182-150130-0033 NOW AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE COURT AND ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET DISTANT FROM THE GARDEN WALL THERE GREW A PEAR TREE SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH OVERHUNG INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND SO FIRST MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE WAS LOOKING THAT WAY
2182-150130-0034 AND BIDDING THE OTHERS KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT MYLES SHINNED UP THIS TREE AND CHOOSING ONE OF THE THICKER LIMBS CLIMBED OUT UPON IT FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THEN LOWERING HIS BODY HE HUNG AT ARM'S LENGTH THE BRANCH BENDING WITH HIS WEIGHT AND SLOWLY LET HIMSELF DOWN
2182-150130-0035 HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
2182-150130-0036 HE NOTICED THE BROAD SMOOTH WALKS THE GRASSY TERRACE IN FRONT OF THE COUNTESS'S APARTMENTS IN THE DISTANCE THE QUAINT FLOWER BEDS THE YEW TREES TRIMMED INTO ODD SHAPES AND EVEN THE DEAF OLD GARDENER WORKING BARE ARMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AT A FLOWER BED IN THE FAR CORNER BY THE TOOL HOUSE
2182-150130-0037 THE TOP OF THE WALL WAS POINTED LIKE A HOUSE ROOF AND IMMEDIATELY BELOW HIM WAS COVERED BY A THICK GROWTH OF GREEN MOSS AND IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE HUNG THERE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD OFFER A VERY SLIPPERY FOOTHOLD FOR ONE DROPPING UPON THE STEEP SLOPES OF THE TOP
2182-150130-0038 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO DRAW BACK NOW BRACING HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT HE LOOSED HIS HOLD UPON THE LIMB ABOVE THE BRANCH FLEW BACK WITH A RUSH AND HE DROPPED STRIVING TO GRASP THE SLOPING ANGLE WITH HIS FEET
2182-150130-0039 FLEW THROUGH HIS BRAIN LIKE A CLOUD OF FLIES AND THEN A LEAFY GREENNESS SEEMED TO STRIKE UP AGAINST HIM A SPLINTERING CRASH SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS THE LATTICE TOP OF THE ARBOR BROKE UNDER HIM AND WITH ONE FINAL CLUTCH AT THE EMPTY AIR HE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND BENEATH
