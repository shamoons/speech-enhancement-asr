2182-181173-0000 BUT AT LEAST HE UNDERSTOOD AFTER A FEW CONVERSATIONS WITH MISTER HAVISHAM THAT HE COULD GRATIFY ALL HIS NEAREST WISHES AND HE PROCEEDED TO GRATIFY THEM WITH A SIMPLICITY AND DELIGHT WHICH CAUSED MISTER HAVISHAM MUCH DIVERSION
2182-181173-0001 IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
2182-181173-0002 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0003 SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL A PERSON'S BONES CAN BE BUT I'VE SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE BETTER SHE'S A VERY GOOD APPLE WOMAN HE SAID TO MISTER HAVISHAM AS THEY WALKED AWAY
2182-181173-0004 LEAVING THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE STALL ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH AND NOT AT ALL BELIEVING IN HER GREAT FORTUNE ONCE WHEN I FELL DOWN AND CUT MY KNEE SHE GAVE ME AN APPLE FOR NOTHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER FOR IT YOU KNOW
2182-181173-0005 YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND TO YOU IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS HONEST SIMPLE LITTLE MIND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD FORGET KINDNESSES THE INTERVIEW WITH DICK WAS QUITE EXCITING
2182-181173-0006 DICK HAD JUST BEEN HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH JAKE AND WAS IN LOW SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN CEDRIC CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD COME TO GIVE HIM WHAT SEEMED A VERY GREAT THING TO HIM AND WOULD SET ALL HIS TROUBLES RIGHT
2182-181173-0007 THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
2182-181173-0008 MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
2182-181173-0009 HE'S VERY KIND IF HE IS AN EARL AND HE SENT ME A LOT OF MONEY BY MISTER HAVISHAM AND I'VE BROUGHT SOME TO YOU TO BUY JAKE OUT
2182-181173-0010 AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
2182-181173-0011 HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
2182-181173-0012 WELL GOOD BYE HE SAID AND THOUGH HE TRIED TO SPEAK STEADILY THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE AND HE WINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES AND I HOPE TRADE'LL BE GOOD I'M SORRY I'M GOING AWAY TO LEAVE YOU
2182-181173-0013 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
2182-181173-0014 AND HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT HE FELT JUST THEN IF HE HAD TRIED PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY HE DIDN'T TRY AND ONLY WINKED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED A LUMP IN HIS THROAT I WISH YE WASN'T GOIN AWAY HE SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
2182-181173-0015 THEN HE WINKED HIS EYES AGAIN THEN HE LOOKED AT MISTER HAVISHAM AND TOUCHED HIS CAP THANKY SIR FUR BRINGIN HIM DOWN HERE AN FUR WOT YE'VE DONE HE'S HE'S A QUEER LITTLE FELLER HE ADDED I'VE ALLERS THORT A HEAP OF HIM

2182-181173-0024 WHEN THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE DOOR THEN A CURIOUS FEELING OF LONELINESS CAME UPON THE LITTLE BOY HIS MAMMA HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN HER ROOM FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS HER EYES LOOKED LARGE AND WET AND HER SWEET MOUTH WAS TREMBLING
2182-181173-0025 CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
