2182-181183-0000 OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
2182-181183-0001 ONE SAID HE WAS ENGAGED TO A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE ANOTHER SAID HE HAD JUST BEEN MARRIED THE ONLY THING IN FACT WHICH WAS NOT SAID WAS THAT HE WAS A LITTLE BOY BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
2182-181183-0002 WITH HANDSOME LEGS AND CURLY HAIR ONE SAID HE WAS NO RELATION TO THE EARL OF DORINCOURT AT ALL BUT WAS A SMALL IMPOSTOR WHO HAD SOLD NEWSPAPERS AND SLEPT IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK BEFORE HIS MOTHER IMPOSED UPON THE FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0003 WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
2182-181183-0004 BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AGREED THAT THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WAS HER DEADLY ENEMY AND WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER SON AS HIS HEIR IF HE COULD HELP IT AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SLIGHT FLAW IN THE PAPERS SHE HAD PRODUCED
2182-181183-0005 IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
2182-181183-0006 THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
2182-181183-0007 BUT EACH WRITE A LETTER TO CEDRIC CONTAINING ASSURANCES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THEY WROTE THOSE LETTERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS AND AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THEM THEY HANDED THEM OVER TO EACH OTHER TO BE READ
2182-181183-0008 THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
2182-181183-0009 AN WE SAY HOLD ON AS LONGS U KIN
2182-181183-0010 THERE IS A LOT OF OLE THEVES WIL MAKE AL THEY KIN OF U

2182-181183-0012 AN ILE SEE NO HARM CUMS TO U ENNY BIG FELER THAT TRISE TO CUM IT OVER U
2182-181183-0013 SO NO MORE AT PRESENT DICK
2182-181183-0014 I BELIEVE ITS A PUT UP JOB AND THEM THATS DONE IT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AFTER SHARP AND WHAT I WRITE TO SAY IS TWO THINGS
2182-181183-0015 AND IF THE WORST HAPPENS AND THEM EARLS IS TOO MANY FOR US THERES A PARTNERSHIP IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS READY FOR YOU WHEN YURE OLD ENOUGH AND A HOME AND A FRIEND IN
2182-181183-0016 SILAS HOBBS WELL SAID MISTER HOBBS HE'S PERVIDED FOR BETWEEN US IF HE AINT A EARL SO HE IS SAID DICK I'D HA STOOD BY HIM BLEST IF I DIDN'T LIKE THAT LITTLE FELLER FUST RATE
2182-181183-0017 THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
2182-181183-0018 BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
2182-181183-0019 AND DICK WAS STARING AT ONE OF THEM WITH HIS EYES AND MOUTH OPEN AND HIS SHARP FACE ALMOST PALE WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT'S TO PAY DICK SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAS PARALYZED YOU DICK REALLY DID LOOK AS IF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED
2182-181183-0020 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0021 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2182-181183-0022 MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
2182-181183-0023 AS HE THREW THE PAPER DOWN ON THE COUNTER HELLO
2182-181183-0024 LOOK AT IT PANTED DICK
2182-181183-0025 THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE
2182-181183-0026 THAT'S WHO DONE IT SHE WAS ALLERS UP TO HER TRICKS AN I'LL TELL YER WOT COME TO ME THE MINNIT I SAW HER PICTUR THERE WAS ONE O THEM PAPERS WE SAW HAD A LETTER IN IT THAT SAID SOMETHIN BOUT HER BOY AN IT SAID HE HAD A SCAR ON HIS CHIN
2182-181183-0027 PUT THEM TWO TOGETHER HER N THAT THERE SCAR WHY THAT THERE BOY O HERS AINT NO MORE A LORD THAN I AM IT'S BEN'S BOY THE LITTLE CHAP SHE HIT WHEN SHE LET FLY THAT PLATE AT ME
2182-181183-0028 PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP BOY AND EARNING HIS LIVING IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY HAD MADE HIM STILL SHARPER HE HAD LEARNED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
2182-181183-0029 AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
2182-181183-0030 THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
2182-181183-0031 THAT'S SO HE REPLIED THIS HERE CALLS FOR LAWYERS AND LEAVING THE STORE IN THE CARE OF A SUBSTITUTE HE STRUGGLED INTO HIS COAT AND MARCHED DOWN TOWN WITH DICK AND THE TWO PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ROMANTIC STORY IN MISTER HARRISON'S OFFICE
2182-181183-0032 MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
2182-181183-0033 FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
2182-181183-0034 IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0035 AND ACTUALLY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN TWO LETTERS HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ONE SPEEDING OUT OF NEW YORK HARBOR ON A MAIL STEAMER ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND AND THE OTHER ON A TRAIN CARRYING LETTERS AND PASSENGERS BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA
2182-181183-0036 AND THE SECOND TO BENJAMIN TIPTON
