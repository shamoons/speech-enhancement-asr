2196-170151-0000 IT OFTTIMES REQUIRES HEROIC COURAGE TO FACE FRUITLESS EFFORT TO TAKE UP THE BROKEN STRANDS OF A LIFE WORK TO LOOK BRAVELY TOWARD THE FUTURE AND PROCEED UNDAUNTED ON OUR WAY
2196-170151-0001 BUT WHAT TO OUR EYES MAY SEEM HOPELESS FAILURE IS OFTEN BUT THE DAWNING OF A GREATER SUCCESS IT MAY CONTAIN IN ITS DEBRIS THE FOUNDATION MATERIAL OF A MIGHTY PURPOSE OR THE REVELATION OF NEW AND HIGHER POSSIBILITIES
2196-170151-0002 SOME YEARS AGO IT WAS PROPOSED TO SEND LOGS FROM CANADA TO NEW YORK BY A NEW METHOD THE INGENIOUS PLAN OF MISTER JOGGINS WAS TO BIND GREAT LOGS TOGETHER BY CABLES AND IRON GIRDERS
2196-170151-0003 AND THE ANGRY WATERS SCATTERED THE LOGS FAR AND WIDE THE CHIEF OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON HEARD OF THE FAILURE OF THE EXPERIMENT AND AT ONCE SENT WORD TO SHIPMASTERS THE WORLD OVER
2196-170151-0004 URGING THEM TO WATCH CAREFULLY FOR THESE LOGS WHICH HE DESCRIBED AND TO NOTE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EACH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND THE TIME THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE HUNDREDS OF CAPTAINS SAILING OVER THE WATERS OF THE EARTH
2196-170151-0005 NOTED THE LOGS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE SOUTH SEAS FOR INTO ALL WATERS DID THESE VENTURESOME ONES TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF REPORTS WERE MADE COVERING A PERIOD OF WEEKS AND MONTHS
2196-170151-0006 THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE THEN CAREFULLY COLLATED SYSTEMATIZED AND TABULATED AND DISCOVERIES WERE MADE AS TO THE COURSE OF OCEAN CURRENTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSS OF THE JOGGINS RAFT WAS NOT A REAL FAILURE
2196-170151-0007 FOR IT LED TO ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES IN MODERN MARINE GEOGRAPHY AND NAVIGATION IN OUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DISPOSED TO SPEAK IN A PATRONIZING TONE
2196-170151-0008 BUT THEIR FAILURE TO TRANSMUTE THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF CHEMISTRY THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED BUT THEY BROUGHT INTO VOGUE THE NATURAL PROCESSES OF SUBLIMATION FILTRATION
2196-170151-0009 DISTILLATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION THEY INVENTED THE ALEMBIC THE RETORT THE SAND BATH THE WATER BATH AND OTHER VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS TO THEM IS DUE THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY SULPHURIC ETHER AND PHOSPHORUS
2196-170151-0010 AND ITS USE IN GUNPOWDER AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTILLATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THIS WAS THE SUCCESS OF FAILURE A WONDROUS PROCESS OF NATURE FOR THE HIGHEST GROWTH A MIGHTY LESSON OF COMFORT STRENGTH AND ENCOURAGEMENT
2196-170151-0011 IN DISCOVERING AMERICA COLUMBUS FAILED ABSOLUTELY HIS INGENIOUS REASONING AND EXPERIMENT LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT BY SAILING WESTWARD HE WOULD REACH INDIA EVERY REDMAN IN AMERICA CARRIES IN HIS NAME INDIAN
2196-170151-0012 THE PERPETUATION OF THE MEMORY OF THE FAILURE OF COLUMBUS THE GENOESE NAVIGATOR DID NOT REACH INDIA THE CARGO OF SOUVENIRS HE TOOK BACK TO SPAIN TO SHOW TO FERDINAND AND ISABELLA AS PROOFS OF HIS SUCCESS
2196-170151-0013 REALLY ATTESTED HIS FAILURE BUT THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA WAS A GREATER SUCCESS THAN WAS ANY FINDING OF A BACK DOOR TO INDIA WHEN DAVID LIVINGSTONE HAD SUPPLEMENTED HIS THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION BY A MEDICAL COURSE
2196-170151-0014 OPENED A WHOLE CONTINENT TO LIGHT AND TRUTH HIS STUDY PROVED AN IDEAL PREPARATION FOR HIS LABORS AS PHYSICIAN EXPLORER TEACHER AND EVANGEL IN THE WILDS OF AFRICA
2196-170151-0015 BUSINESS REVERSES AND THE FAILURE OF HIS PARTNER THREW UPON THE BROAD SHOULDERS AND THE STILL BROADER HONOR AND HONESTY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT A BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT FORCED HIM TO WRITE
2196-170151-0016 HIS BRUSH STROKES PUT ON IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS BEFORE GOING TO HIS MENIAL DUTIES AS A RAILWAY PORTER IN THE DUSK LIKE THAT PERPETUATED ON HIS CANVAS MEANT STRENGTH FOOD AND MEDICINE FOR THE DYING WIFE HE ADORED
2196-170151-0017 THE ART FAILURE THAT CAST HIM INTO THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY UNIFIED WITH MARVELLOUS INTENSITY ALL THE FINER ELEMENTS OF HIS NATURE THIS RARE SPIRITUAL UNITY
2196-170151-0018 THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
2196-170151-0019 FAILURE IS OFTEN THE TURNING POINT THE PIVOT OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SWINGS US TO HIGHER LEVELS IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IT MAY NOT BE FAME IT MAY BE NEW DRAUGHTS OF SPIRITUAL MORAL OR MENTAL INSPIRATION
2196-170151-0020 THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
2196-170151-0021 TRUER NOBLER THEN POVERTY HAS BEEN RICHES FAILURE HAS BEEN A SUCCESS IF WEALTH HAS COME TO ME AND HAS MADE ME VAIN ARROGANT CONTEMPTUOUS UNCHARITABLE CYNICAL
2196-170151-0022 IT HAS NOT BEEN RICHES IT HAS BEEN DARK TREACHEROUS POVERTY THAT STOLE FROM ME EVEN MYSELF ALL THINGS BECOME FOR US THEN WHAT WE TAKE FROM THEM FAILURE IS ONE OF GOD'S EDUCATORS
2196-170151-0023 IT IS EXPERIENCE LEADING MAN TO HIGHER THINGS IT IS THE REVELATION OF A WAY A PATH HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO US THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE GREATEST REAL SUCCESSES
2196-170151-0024 LOOK BACK WITH SERENE HAPPINESS ON THEIR FAILURES THE TURNING OF THE FACE OF TIME SHOWS ALL THINGS IN A WONDROUSLY ILLUMINATED AND SATISFYING PERSPECTIVE MANY A MAN IS THANKFUL TO DAY THAT SOME PETTY SUCCESS FOR WHICH HE ONCE STRUGGLED
2196-170151-0025 MELTED INTO THIN AIR AS HIS HAND SOUGHT TO CLUTCH IT FAILURE IS OFTEN THE ROCK BOTTOM FOUNDATION OF REAL SUCCESS IF MAN IN A FEW INSTANCES OF HIS LIFE CAN SAY
2196-170151-0026 THE DEATH OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SEED IS THE PRELUDE TO ITS RESURRECTION AS WHEAT IT IS AT NIGHT IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE PRECEDING DAWN THAT PLANTS GROW BEST THAT THEY MOST INCREASE IN SIZE
2196-170151-0027 MAY THIS NOT BE ONE OF NATURE'S GENTLE SHOWINGS TO MAN OF THE TIMES WHEN HE GROWS BEST OF THE DARKNESS OF FAILURE THAT IS EVOLVING INTO THE SUNLIGHT OF SUCCESS LET US FEAR ONLY THE FAILURE OF NOT LIVING THE RIGHT AS WE SEE IT
2196-170151-0028 LEAVING THE RESULTS TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INFINITE IF WE THINK OF ANY SUPREME MOMENT OF OUR LIVES ANY GREAT SUCCESS ANY ONE WHO IS DEAR TO US AND THEN CONSIDER HOW WE REACHED THAT MOMENT THAT SUCCESS
2196-170151-0029 WE WILL SEE HOW LOGICAL HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF OUR JOY AND SUCCESS FROM SORROW AND FAILURE AND THAT WHAT GIVES US MOST HAPPINESS TO DAY IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED WITH WHAT ONCE CAUSED US SORROW
2196-170151-0030 HAVE HAD THEIR SOURCE AND THEIR TRICKLING INCREASE INTO VOLUME AMONG THE DARK GLOOMY RECESSES OF OUR FAILURE THERE IS NO HONEST AND TRUE WORK
2196-170151-0031 IN CONTINUOUS HARMONY WITH THEM
2196-170151-0032 NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
2196-170151-0033 THEY NEED NOT DISHEARTEN US THEY SHOULD PROVE SOURCES OF NEW STRENGTH THE ROCKY WAY MAY PROVE SAFER THAN THE SLIPPERY PATH OF SMOOTHNESS BIRDS CANNOT FLY BEST WITH THE WIND BUT AGAINST IT SHIPS DO NOT PROGRESS IN CALM
2196-170151-0034 WHEN THE SAILS FLAP IDLY AGAINST THE UNSTRAINED MASTS
