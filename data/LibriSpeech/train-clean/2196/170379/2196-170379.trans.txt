2196-170379-0000 IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
2196-170379-0001 WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE HUMAN ORGANISM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN AS HE IS TODAY THE OLDER THEORIES SHOW ALMOST AS MUCH DISPARITY AS TODAY BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF HISTORY
2196-170379-0002 BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
2196-170379-0003 AND WHICH DREW THEIR UNIQUE QUALITIES FROM THE SUN MOON AND STARS CHARCOT
2196-170379-0004 WAS CONVINCED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A FORM OF HYSTERIA AND THAT ONLY HYSTERICS COULD BE HYPNOTIZED THE FORMER MESMER THOUGHT FURTHER THAT METAL BECAME IMBUED BY THE SOLAR QUALITIES AND HIS SYSTEM IS ALSO KNOWN AS METALOGY
2196-170379-0005 NOTABLY DOCTOR WILLIAM S KROGER A PSYCHIATRICALLY ORIENTED OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST WHO LIMITS HIS PRACTICE TO HYPNOTHERAPY BELIEVE HYPNOSIS IS A CONVICTION PHENOMENON WHICH PRODUCES RESULTS THAT PARALLEL THE PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0006 PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
2196-170379-0007 IS CONVINCED THAT YOU CANNOT WILL YOURSELF TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND THAT WHENEVER THE WILL AND THE IMAGINATION COME INTO CONFLICT
2196-170379-0008 THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY OF COURSE WITH THE AUTHOR'S ALREADY DISCUSSED VISUAL IMAGERY TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF IMAGINATION DOCTOR KROGER LIKE A FEW OTHERS HAS PROVED TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION THAT ALL HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0009 CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
2196-170379-0010 BUT WORDS WHICH RING A BELL OR TAP THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT
2196-170379-0011 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0012 ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT A STRONG INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HYPNOSIS IN THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK I EXPLAINED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTION IN WHICH THE SUBJECT ADOPTED AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE
2196-170379-0013 ALLOWING HIM TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION THIS IS EXCELLENT AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW SUGGESTION WORKS THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE HYPNOTIC DILEMMA AND THE ANSWER IS FAR FROM SOLVED
2196-170379-0014 HYPNOTISTS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO USE ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW IT HAS BEEN HARNESSED FOR THEIR USE
2196-170379-0015 IF THERE IS ONE THING VIRTUALLY CERTAIN ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT IS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE INHIBITED AND OTHER PARTS EXPANDED BY THE PROCESS
2196-170379-0016 BUT WHY IS THIS HIGH ORDER OF CONCENTRATION SO EASY UNDER HYPNOSIS WHEN ASIANS NOTABLY THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR CENTURIES TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE SUBJECT FOR AS LONG AS FOUR OR FIVE SECONDS
2196-170379-0017 WE DO NOT KNOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS METAMORPHOSIS OF AN ORDINARY BRAIN INTO AN ORGAN OF CONCENTRATED POWER ACCORDING TO JANET THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES
2196-170379-0018 WHICH TAKES OVER THE USUAL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TYPE OF THINKING IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE PROCESS MAY BE ATAVISTIC ONE OF THE NEWER THEORIES ONE HELD BY DOCTOR LEWIS R WOLBERG A PSYCHOANALYST
2196-170379-0019 AND A LIMITATION OF SENSORY CHANNELS SUCH AS TAKES PLACE IN SLEEP HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OPERATES THROUGH TRANSFERENCE OTHERS AGREE THAT IT IS A TRANSFERENCE PROCESS
2196-170379-0020 BUT THAT IT IS MORE OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUBJECT'S OWN PSYCHIC PROCESSES WHICH IS ENLARGED TO INCLUDE THE VOICE OF THE HYPNOTIST OR HIS OWN THOUGHTS OR VOICE INCIDENTALLY AN EXCELLENT BOOK ALONG THESE THEORETICAL LINES IS HYPNOTISM
2196-170379-0021 ACTUALLY HYPNOTISTS TODAY
2196-170379-0022 MILTON V KLINE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY POSTULATES THAT HYPNOSIS IS PRIMARILY RETROGRESSIVE HE HAS WRITTEN THAT THE ORGANISM FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY ON VARIOUS LEVELS OF BEHAVIOR REGRESSION
2196-170379-0023 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
2196-170379-0024 MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
2196-170379-0025 STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IS THAT HYPNOSIS SHOULD BE EQUATED WITH STATES OF IMMOBILIZATION ON THE BASIS OF HIS OBSERVATION THAT SOME SUBJECTS EQUATE HYPNOSIS WITH DEATH
2196-170379-0026 OF ANIMALS TO AVOID DANGER OTHERS PRIMARILY EUROPEANS HAVE POINTED OUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE HYPNOTIC STATE OF ANIMALS AND MAN ANOTHER WIDELY HELD THEORY IS THAT HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF DISSOCIATION
2196-170379-0027 MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
2196-170379-0028 WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
2196-170379-0029 THIRDLY FROM THE PERSON ACTING AS A HYPNOTIZED PERSON ROLE PLAYING AND FOURTHLY FROM A SUSPENSION OF THE CRITICAL FACULTIES ALONG THE LAST NAMED LINE I BELIEVE THAT HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS
2196-170379-0030 WHICH SUPERSEDE ALL ELSE IN THE HYPNOTIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY MORE THEORIES I BELIEVE ARE PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT THE ONES NAMED WILL DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS VOLUME INCIDENTALLY
2196-170379-0031 ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO SELF HYPNOSIS EXCEPT WHERE AS IN TRANSFERENCE IT IS OBVIOUS A THERAPIST IS NEEDED IN CONCLUSION THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE
2196-170379-0032 WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
2196-170379-0033 UNLESS DEFINITE SLEEP SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN BY THE THERAPIST'S SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND AT LENGTH AND SURELY NOTHING CONNOTATES SLEEP MORE THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES
2196-170379-0034 AND SO IN MY VIEW
