2384-152900-0000 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0003 THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0006 FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0009 AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0012 THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0015 THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0027 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0030 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0033 WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0036 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0039 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0048 AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0051 BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0054 THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0057 I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0060 IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0069 WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0072 WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0078 DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0081 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0084 I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0087 MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
