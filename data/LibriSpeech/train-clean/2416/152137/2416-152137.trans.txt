2416-152137-0000 A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
2416-152137-0001 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
2416-152137-0002 AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
2416-152137-0003 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0005 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
2416-152137-0006 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0007 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0008 SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
2416-152137-0009 OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
2416-152137-0010 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0012 WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
2416-152137-0013 HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
2416-152137-0014 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0015 AND THEN SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION LEVEL STARES FROM THE WOMEN RETURNED HIS GAZE
2416-152137-0016 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0018 THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
2416-152137-0019 TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
2416-152137-0020 HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
2416-152137-0021 WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
2416-152137-0022 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
2416-152137-0023 POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
2416-152137-0024 AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
2416-152137-0025 ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME IT WAS ONLY ONE MORE OCCASION ADDED TO THE INNUMERABLE ONES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IN WHICH SHE HAD ELUDED HIM AND NOW THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0026 AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0027 WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
2416-152137-0028 JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
2416-152137-0029 ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
2416-152137-0030 INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152137-0033 THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
2416-152137-0034 AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE
2416-152137-0035 SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE
