2436-2476-0008 THE MOON HAD DWINDLED TO A PIN POINT OF LIGHT BESIDE THE CRESCENT EARTH AND BEHIND THEM OUR SUN BLAZED VISUALLY THE LARGEST ORB IN THE HEAVENS IT WAS SOME SIXTY EIGHT MILLION MILES FROM THE EARTH TO MARS
2436-2476-0009 A FLIGHT ORDINARILY OF SOME TEN DAYS THERE WERE FIVE TABLES IN THE DINING SALON EACH WITH EIGHT SEATS SNAP AND I HAD ONE OF THE TABLES WE SAT AT THE ENDS WITH THE PASSENGERS ON EACH OF THE SIDES

2436-2476-0017 THE TALL ENGLISHMAN IN HIS WHITE LINEN SUIT BOWED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT MY COMPLIMENTS MISTER HALJAN I HOPE YOU HAVE NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS ELSE WE WILL MAKE YOUR TABLE HERE VERY MISERABLE
2436-2476-0018 THE THIRD PASSENGER HAD EVIDENTLY KEPT OUT OF THE ARGUMENT SNAP INTRODUCED HIM AS RANCE RANKIN AN AMERICAN A QUIET BLOND FELLOW OF THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY I ORDERED MY BREAKFAST AND LET THE ARGUMENT GO ON
2436-2476-0019 I DEAL IN TRICKS HOW TO FOOL AN AUDIENCE HIS KEEN AMUSED GAZE WAS ON OB HAHN THIS GENTLEMAN FROM VENUS AND I HAVE TOO MUCH IN COMMON TO ARGUE
2436-2476-0020 I LIKE TO EAT IN QUIET ARGUING PASSENGERS ALWAYS ANNOY ME THERE WERE STILL THREE SEATS VACANT AT OUR TABLE I WONDERED WHO WOULD OCCUPY THEM I SOON LEARNED THE ANSWER FOR ONE SEAT AT LEAST RANKIN SAID CALMLY
2436-2476-0021 HIS GLANCE WENT TO THE EMPTY SEAT AT MY RIGHT HAND THE VENZA ISN'T THAT HER NAME SHE AND I ARE DESTINED FOR THE SAME THEATER IN FERROK SHAHN SO VENZA WAS TO SIT BESIDE ME IT WAS GOOD NEWS
2436-2476-0022 TEN DAYS OF A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT THREE TIMES A DAY WOULD BE INTOLERABLE BUT THE CHEERFUL VENZA WOULD HELP SHE NEVER EATS THE MIDDAY MEAL SAID SNAP SHE'S ON THE DECK HAVING ORANGE JUICE I GUESS IT'S THE OLD GAG ABOUT DIET EH
2436-2476-0023 AS A MAN WHO LOOKED HARDLY TWENTY FIVE HE WAS AT THIS MOMENT EVIDENTLY IN A GAY MOOD HIS CLEAN CUT HANDSOME PROFILE WITH ITS POETIC DARK CURLS
2436-2476-0024 THERE SEEMED LITTLE OF THE VILLAIN ABOUT HIM AND I SAW ANITA PRINCE NOW AS A DARK HAIRED BLACK EYED LITTLE BEAUTY IN FEATURE RESEMBLING HER BROTHER VERY STRONGLY SHE PRESENTLY FINISHED HER MEAL SHE ROSE WITH HIM AFTER HER
2436-2476-0025 I ANSWERED HER GREETING AND MET GEORGE PRINCE'S CASUAL GAZE HE TOO SMILED AS THOUGH TO SIGNIFY THAT HIS SISTER HAD TOLD HIM OF THE SERVICE I HAD DONE HER OR WAS HIS SMILE AN IRONICAL MEMORY OF HOW HE HAD ELUDED ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CHASED HIM
2436-2476-0026 I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON
2436-2476-0027 MY ATTENTION WAS BROUGHT SUDDENLY BACK TO THE REALITY OF OUR TABLE I HEARD OB HAHN'S SILKY VOICE WE PASSED QUITE CLOSE TO THE MOON LAST NIGHT MISTER DEAN YES SAID SNAP WE DID DIDN'T WE ALWAYS DO
2436-2476-0028 IT'S A TECHNICAL PROBLEM OF THE EXIGENCIES OF INTERSTELLAR NAVIGATION EXPLAIN IT TO THEM GREGG YOU'RE AN EXPERT I WAVED IT AWAY WITH A LAUGH THERE WAS A BRIEF SILENCE I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING SIR ARTHUR CONISTON'S QUEER LOOK
2436-2476-0029 AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO KEEN A GLANCE AS RANCE RANKIN SHOT AT ME WERE ALL THREE PEOPLE AWARE OF GRANTLINE'S TREASURE ON THE MOON IT SUDDENLY SEEMED SO I WISHED FERVENTLY AT THAT INSTANT THAT THE TEN DAYS OF THIS VOYAGE WERE OVER CAPTAIN CARTER WAS RIGHT
2436-2476-0030 COMING BACK WE SHOULD HAVE A CORDON OF INTERPLANETARY POLICE ABOARD SIR ARTHUR BROKE THE AWKWARD SILENCE MAGNIFICENT SIGHT THE MOON FROM SO CLOSE THOUGH I WAS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF PRESSURE SICKNESS TO BE UP TO SEE IT
2436-2476-0031 WHEN ANOTHER INCIDENT SHOCKED ME THE TWO OTHER PASSENGERS AT OUR TABLE CAME IN AND TOOK THEIR SEATS A MARTIAN GIRL AND MAN THE GIRL HAD THE SEAT AT MY LEFT WITH THE MAN BESIDE HER ALL MARTIANS ARE TALL

2436-2476-0034 THE MARTIAN EQUIVALENT OF MISTER AND MISS
2436-2476-0035 NOT SPINDLY LIKE MOST MARTIANS THIS FELLOW FOR ALL HIS SEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT WAS ALMOST HEAVY SET HE WORE A PLAITED LEATHER JERKIN BENEATH HIS ROBE AND KNEE PANTS OF LEATHER OUT OF WHICH HIS LOWER LEGS SHOWED AS GRAY HAIRY PILLARS OF STRENGTH

2436-2476-0039 INADVERTENTLY PUSHED BACK HIS ROBE TO BARE HIS FOREARM AN INSTANT ONLY THEN IT DROPPED TO HIS WRIST BUT IN THAT INSTANT I HAD SEEN UPON THE GRAY FLESH A THIN SEAR TURNED RED A VERY RECENT BURN
2436-2476-0040 AS THOUGH A PENCIL RAY OF HEAT HAD CAUGHT HIS ARM MY MIND FLUNG BACK ONLY LAST NIGHT IN THE CITY CORRIDOR SNAP AND I HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A MARTIAN I HAD SHOT AT HIM WITH A HEAT RAY I THOUGHT I HAD HIT HIM ON THE ARM
