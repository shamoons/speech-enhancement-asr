248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
