248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
