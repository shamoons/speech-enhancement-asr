250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0001 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0004 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0007 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0010 AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0013 HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0016 TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0019 FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0022 WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0025 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0028 CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0031 BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0034 AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0040 ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0043 BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0046 SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0049 WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0052 THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0061 NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
