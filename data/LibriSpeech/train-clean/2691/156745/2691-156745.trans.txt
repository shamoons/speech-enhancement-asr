2691-156745-0001 THE REPORT OF OUR AFFLICTION SPREAD RAPIDLY AND THE WELL MEANING TENDER HEARTED WOMEN AT THE FORT CAME TO CONDOLE AND WEEP WITH US AND MADE THEIR CHILDREN WEEP ALSO BY URGING
2691-156745-0002 NOW DO SAY SOMETHING COMFORTING TO THESE POOR LITTLE GIRLS WHO WERE FROZEN AND STARVED UP IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ARE NOW ORPHANS IN A STRANGE LAND WITHOUT ANY HOME OR ANY ONE TO CARE FOR THEM SUCH ORDEALS WERE TOO OVERWHELMING
2691-156745-0003 I WOULD RUSH OFF ALONE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TORTURING SYMPATHY EVEN THERE I MET THOSE WHO WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH GREAT SERIOUS EYES SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND MOURNFULLY SAY YOU POOR LITTLE MITE
2691-156745-0004 HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE IF YOU HAD DIED IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH YOUR DEAR MOTHER INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE TO STRUGGLE IN THIS WICKED WORLD THIS WOULD BUT INCREASE MY DISTRESS FOR I DID NOT WANT TO BE DEAD AND BURIED UP THERE UNDER THE COLD DEEP SNOW
2691-156745-0005 AND I KNEW THAT MOTHER DID NOT WANT ME TO BE THERE EITHER HAD SHE NOT SENT ME AWAY TO SAVE ME AND ASKED GOD OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME
2691-156745-0006 INTENSE EXCITEMENT AND INDIGNATION PREVAILED AT THE FORT AFTER CAPTAIN FALLON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY GAVE THEIR ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITIONS FOUND AT THE MOUNTAIN CAMPS AND OF INTERVIEWS HAD WITH KESEBERG WHOM THEY NOW CALLED CANNIBAL

2691-156745-0008 BUT ALSO OF HAVING WANTONLY TAKEN THE LIFE OF MISSUS MURPHY AND OF MY MOTHER SOME DECLARED HIM CRAZY OTHERS CALLED HIM A MONSTER KESEBERG DENIED THESE CHARGES AND
2691-156745-0009 HE STATED THAT MISSUS MURPHY HAD DIED OF STARVATION SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD RELIEF AND THAT MY MOTHER HAD WATCHED BY FATHER'S BEDSIDE UNTIL HE DIED
2691-156745-0010 AFTER PREPARING HIS BODY FOR BURIAL SHE HAD STARTED OUT ON THE TRAIL TO GO TO HER CHILDREN IN ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE DISTANCE FROM HER CAMP TO HIS SHE HAD STRAYED AND WANDERED ABOUT FAR INTO THE NIGHT
2691-156745-0011 AND FINALLY REACHED HIS CABIN WET SHIVERING AND GRIEF STRICKEN YET DETERMINED TO PUSH ONWARD SHE HAD BROUGHT NOTHING WITH HER BUT TOLD HIM WHERE TO FIND MONEY TO TAKE TO HER CHILDREN IN THE EVENT OF HER NOT REACHING THEM
2691-156745-0012 HE STATED THAT HE OFFERED HER FOOD WHICH SHE REFUSED HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HER TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING AND WHILE THEY WERE TALKING SHE SANK UPON THE FLOOR COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AND HE COVERED HER WITH BLANKETS AND MADE A FIRE TO WARM HER
2691-156745-0013 IN THE MORNING HE FOUND HER COLD IN DEATH
2691-156745-0014 SAVED HIM FROM PERSONAL VIOLENCE BUT NOT FROM SUSPICION AND ILL WILL WOMEN SHUNNED HIM AND CHILDREN STONED HIM AS HE WALKED ABOUT THE FORT THE CALIFORNIA STAR PRINTED IN FULL THE ACCOUNT OF THE FALLON PARTY
2691-156745-0015 AND BLOOD CURDLING EDITORIALS INCREASED PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST KESEBERG STAMPING HIM WITH THE MARK OF CAIN AND CLOSING THE DOOR OF EVERY HOME AGAINST HIM
2691-156745-0016 ALSO OF WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THE ALLEGED MURDER OF OUR MOTHER STILL WE DID HEAR FRAGMENTS OF CONVERSATIONS WHICH GREATLY DISTURBED US AND OUR SISTERS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ANSWER SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS MEANWHILE
2691-156745-0017 MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS FOR US WERE BREWING AT THE FORT FALLON'S PARTY DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT OF ITS CLAIM IT HAD GONE UP THE MOUNTAINS UNDER PROMISE THAT ITS MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY A PER DIEM AS RESCUERS
2691-156745-0018 TAKEN FROM CONCEALMENT ON KESEBERG'S PERSON AND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS ADDITIONAL TAKEN FROM A CACHE THAT KESEBERG HAD DISCLOSED AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD PARTIALLY STRANGLED HIM
2691-156745-0019 SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO CAPTAIN FALLON TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF HIS PARTY AND THE OTHER HALF SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF A GUARDIAN
2691-156745-0020 NOTWITHSTANDING THESE PLANS FOR OUR WELL BEING UNACCOUNTABLE DELAYS FOLLOWED MAKING OUR SITUATION DAILY MORE TRYING
2691-156745-0021 THEY HAD NOT FULLY RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF THEIR LONG PRIVATIONS AND PHYSICAL SUFFERINGS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LOSS OF PARENTS AND MEANS OF SUPPORT PLACED UPON THEM RESPONSIBILITIES GREATER THAN THEY COULD CARRY
2691-156745-0022 NO MATTER HOW BRAVELY THEY STROVE TO MEET THE SITUATION HOW CAN WE PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES AND THESE LITTLE SISTERS WAS A QUESTION WHICH HAUNTED THEM BY NIGHT AND PERPLEXED THEM BY DAY
2691-156745-0023 THEY HAD NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR FRIENDS IN EASTERN STATES AND THE WOMEN AT THE FORT COULD ILL AFFORD TO PROVIDE LONGER FOR US SINCE THEIR BREAD WINNERS WERE STILL WITH FREMONT AND THEIR OWN SUPPLIES WERE LIMITED
2691-156745-0024 FINALLY MY TWO ELDEST SISTERS WERE GIVEN EMPLOYMENT BY DIFFERENT FAMILIES IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD WHICH THEY SHARED WITH US BUT IT WAS OFTEN INSUFFICIENT AND WE LITTLE ONES DRIFTED ALONG FORLORNLY SOMETIMES HOME

2691-156745-0026 WE THREE WERE PLAYING NEAR IT WHEN A JOYOUS INDIAN GIRL WITH A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES ON HER HEAD RAN DOWN THE BANK TO THE WATER'S EDGE WE FOLLOWING
2691-156745-0027 MERRILY UP AND DOWN IN THE CLEAR WATER SHE LATHERED THEM WITH A FRESHLY GATHERED SOAP ROOT AND CLEANSED THEM ACCORDING TO THE WAYS OF THE SPANISH MISSION TEACHERS AS SHE TIED THE WET GARMENTS IN A BUNDLE AND TURNED TO CARRY THEM TO THE DRYING GROUND FRANCES
2691-156745-0028 FLOATING NEAR THE END OF THE BOARD AND LAY DOWN UPON IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CATCHING THEM
2691-156745-0029 SAW THE POPPIES DRIFT JUST BEYOND HER FINGER TIPS SAW HER LEAN A LITTLE FARTHER THEN SLIP HEAD FIRST INTO THE DEEP WATER SUCH SHRIEKS AS TERRIFIED CHILDREN GIVE BROUGHT THE INDIAN GIRL QUICKLY TO OUR AID LIKE A FLASH
2691-156745-0030 SHE TOSSED THE BUNDLE FROM HER HEAD SPRANG INTO THE WATER SNATCHED FRANCES AS SHE ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND RESTORED HER TO US WITHOUT A WORD BEFORE WE HAD RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK SHE WAS GONE
2691-156745-0031 NOT A SOUL WAS IN SIGHT WHEN WE STARTED TOWARD THE FORT ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT THE INEVITABLE IS TO BE WAS WEAVING INTO OUR LIVES
2691-156745-0032 WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO KEEP TRACK OF TIME BY CALENDAR BUT COUNTED IT BY HAPPENINGS SOME WERE MARKED WITH TEARS SOME WITH SMILES AND SOME STOLE UNAWARES UPON US JUST AS ON THAT BRIGHT JUNE EVENING
2691-156745-0033 WHEN WE DID NOT FIND OUR SISTERS AND AIMLESSLY FOLLOWED OTHERS TO THE LITTLE SHOP WHERE A FRIENDLY APPEARING ELDERLY MAN WAS CUTTING SLICES OF MEAT AND HANDING THEM TO CUSTOMERS
2691-156745-0034 WE DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME NOR DID WE REALIZE THAT HE WAS SELLING THE MEAT HE HANDED OUT ONLY THAT WE WANTED SOME SO AFTER ALL THE OTHERS HAD GONE WE ADDRESSED HIM ASKING GRANDPA PLEASE GIVE US A LITTLE PIECE OF MEAT
2691-156745-0035 AND SAID THAT WE SHOULD SLEEP AT HER HOUSE THAT NIGHT AND SEE OUR SISTERS IN THE MORNING SHE ALSO GAVE US PERMISSION TO COOK OUR PIECES OF LIVER OVER HER BED OF LIVE COALS FRANCES OFFERED TO COOK THEM ALL ON HER STICK BUT
2691-156745-0036 I BEING THE SMALLEST CHILD WAS GIVEN THE SHORTEST STICK AND ALLOWED TO STAND NEAREST THE FIRE SOON THE THREE SLICES WERE SIZZLING AND BROWNING FROM THE ENDS OF THREE WILLOW RODS AND SMELLED SO GOOD THAT WE COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO BE DONE
2691-156745-0037 THEN LED US TO THE HOUSE WHERE A NUMBER OF PERSONS HAD GATHERED MOST OF THEM SITTING AT TABLE LAUGHING AND TALKING AND AMONG THEM ELITHA AND LEANNA UPON OUR ENTRANCE THE MERRIMENT CEASED AND ALL EYES WERE TURNED INQUIRINGLY TOWARD US
2691-156745-0038 SOME ONE POINTED TO HIM WHO SAT BESIDE OUR ELDEST SISTER AND GAYLY SAID LOOK AT YOUR NEW BROTHER ANOTHER ASKED
2691-156745-0039 TEARS CAME ALSO TO THE CHILD WIFE'S EYES AS SHE CLASPED HER ARMS ABOUT US SOOTHINGLY ASSURING US THAT SHE WAS STILL OUR SISTER AND WOULD CARE FOR US NEVERTHELESS
2691-156745-0040 SHE AND HER HUSBAND SLIPPED AWAY SOON ON HORSEBACK AND WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WERE TO STAY AT OUR NEIGHBOR'S UNTIL THEY RETURNED FOR US
2691-156745-0041 AND SOME IN THEIR EAGERNESS FORGOT TO ROLL DOWN THEIR SLEEVES BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO TALK ONE TRIUMPHANTLY REPEATED TO EACH NEWCOMER THE MOTHERLY ADVICE WHICH SHE GAVE THE YOUNG COUPLE WHEN SHE FIRST
2691-156745-0042 NOTICED HIS AFFECTION FOR THAT SORROWING GIRL WHO IS TOO PRETTY TO BE IN THIS NEW COUNTRY WITHOUT A PROTECTOR THEY ALSO RECALLED HOW PERRY MC COON'S LAUNCH HAD BROUGHT SUPPLIES UP THE RIVER FOR THE SECOND RELIEF TO TAKE OVER THE MOUNTAINS
2691-156745-0043 AND HOW FINALLY HE HIMSELF HAD CARRIED TO THE BEREAVED DAUGHTER THE LAST ACCOUNTS FROM DONNER CAMP
