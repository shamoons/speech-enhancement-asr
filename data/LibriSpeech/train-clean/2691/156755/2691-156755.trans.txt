2691-156755-0011 AND WHAT A CENTREPIECE IT WAS IT REQUIRED THE CAREFUL HANDLING OF NO LESS THAN THREE PERSONS TO GET IT IN PLACE ON THE TABLE WHERE THE EMPEROR MIGHT SEE AT A GLANCE THE GROUPS OF FIGURES ALONG THE SPLENDID HIGHWAY
2691-156755-0012 OF THE SNOW WHITE POODLE SNUGGLED CLOSE IN THE EMPRESS'S ARMS THEN SHE TOLD HOW SHE HEARD A HEAVY THUD BY THE KITCHEN FIRE WHICH MADE HER RUSH BACK ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE HEAD COOK HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR IN A FAINT
2691-156755-0013 SHE GAVE THE QUICK CALL WHICH BROUGHT THE FRAU WIRTHIN TO THE SCENE OF CONFUSION WHERE IN MUTE AGONY SHE LOOKED FROM SERVANT TO SERVANT UNTIL WITH HANDS CLASPED AND EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE IMPLORED MARIE
2691-156755-0014 TAKE THE HIGHER PLACE FOR THE DAY AND WITH GOD'S HELP MAKE NO MISTAKE THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WHILE THE DINNER WAS BEING SERVED THE EMPEROR ADMIRED THE BUTTER PIECE AND ON HEARING THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF A YOUNG MAIDSERVANT IN THE HOUSE
2691-156755-0015 THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS FROM ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES AND NOT DRESSED FOR PRESENTATION CRIED WITH QUIVERING LIPS
2691-156755-0016 THE GREAT EMPEROR ASKS TO SEE THEE AND THOU MUST COME SHE TOLD HOW POOR RED FACED BEWILDERED MARIE DROPPED HER LADLE AND STARED AT THE SPEAKER
2691-156755-0017 THEN ROLLED DOWN HER SLEEVES WHILE THE FRAU WIRTHIN TIED HER OWN BEST WHITE APRON AROUND HER WAIST AT THE SAME TIME INSTRUCTING HER IN THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE MUST HOLD HER DRESS AT THE SIDES BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND SPREAD THE SKIRT WIDE
2691-156755-0018 YET AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER SHE WAS INFORMED THAT THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS HAD SPOKEN KINDLY TO HER AND THAT SHE HERSELF HAD MADE HER BOW AND BACKED OUT OF THE ROOM ADMIRABLY FOR ONE IN HER POSITION
2691-156755-0019 THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPRESS SHE NOW FINISHED HER MODELLING WITH A DAINTY CENTREPIECE FOR THE BRIDE'S TABLE AND LET ME GO WITH HER WHEN SHE CARRIED IT TO THE VALLEJO MANSION IT GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND WHILE THE FAMILY AND GUESTS WERE ADMIRING IT
2691-156755-0020 SENORA VALLEJO TOOK ME BY THE HAND SAYING IN HER OWN MUSICAL TONGUE COME LITTLE DAUGHTER AND PLAY WHILE YOU WAIT SHE LED ME TO A ROOM THAT HAD PICTURES ON THE WALLS AND LEFT ME SURROUNDED BY TOYS BUT I COULD NOT PLAY
2691-156755-0021 MY EYES WANDERED ABOUT UNTIL THEY BECAME RIVETED ON ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WHERE STOOD A CHILD'S CRIB WHICH LOOKED LIKE GOLD ITS HEAD AND FOOT BOARDS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH FIGURES OF ANGELS
2691-156755-0022 AND A CANOPY OF LACE LIKE A FLEECY CLOUD HOVERED OVER THEM THE BED WAS WHITE BUT THE PILLOWS WERE COVERED WITH PINK SILK AND ENCASED IN SLIPS OF LINEN LAWN EXQUISITE WITH RARE NEEDLEWORK
2691-156755-0023 I TOUCHED IT BEFORE I LEFT THE ROOM WONDERING WHAT THE LITTLE GIRL DREAMED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL BED AND ON THE WAY HOME GRANDMA AND I DISCUSSED ALL THESE THINGS
2691-156755-0024 THE LINEN PILLOW SLIPS WERE AS FINE AS THOSE SENORITA ISABELLA FITCH SHOWED ME WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE FEW HIGHLY PRIZED LESSONS IN SIMPLE DRAWN WORK AND HER COUSIN SENORITA LEESE HAD TAUGHT ME HEMMING
2691-156755-0025 THESE YOUNG LADIES WERE RELATED TO THE VALLEJOS AND ALSO LIVED IN LARGE HOUSES FACING THE PLAZA AND WERE ALWAYS KIND TO GEORGIA AND ME IN FACT SOME OF MY SWEETEST MEMORIES OF SONOMA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THREE SPANISH HOMES
2691-156755-0026 THEIR PEOPLE NEVER ASKED UNFEELING QUESTIONS NOR REPEATED HARROWING TALES AND I DID NOT LEARN UNTIL I WAS GROWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN AMONG THE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND FOR THE RELIEF OF OUR PARTY
2691-156755-0027 I HAVE A FAINT RECOLLECTION OF LISTENING TO THE CHIMES OF THE WEDDING BELLS AND LATER OF HEARING THAT CAPTAIN FRISBIE HAD TAKEN HIS BRIDE AWAY BUT THAT IS ALL FOR ABOUT THAT TIME DEAR OLD JAKIE RETURNED TO US IN ILL HEALTH AND OUR THOUGHTS AND CARE TURNED TO HIM
2691-156755-0028 I HAVE DONE MY BEST WITH THE MEDICINES AT HAND THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS TO BE TRIED IS A TEA STEEPED FROM THE NETTLE ROOT THAT MAY GIVE RELIEF AS SOON AS WE COULD GET READY AFTER THE DOCTOR UTTERED THOSE WORDS GEORGIA AND I EQUIPPED WITH HOE
2691-156755-0029 WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
2691-156755-0030 NO SOONER WOULD I COMMENCE OPERATIONS THAN THE BRANCHES SLIPPING FROM UNDER THE STICK WOULD BRUSH GEORGIA'S FACE AND STRIKE MY HANDS AND ARMS WITH STINGING FORCE AND BY THE TIME WE HAD SECURED THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF ROOTS WE WERE COVERED WITH FIERY WELTS
2691-156755-0031 THE ONE IN FRONT STAGGERING AND HIS SQUAW BEHIND MAKING FRANTIC MOTIONS TO US TO HURRY OVER THE SNAKE FENCE NEAR BY THIS WE DID AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE AND SUCCEEDED NONE TOO SOON FOR AS WE REACHED THE GROUND ON THE SAFE SIDE HE STOPPED US
2691-156755-0032 AND ANGRILY DEMANDED THE CONTENTS OF OUR BASKET WE OPENED IT AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT IT CONTAINED HE STAMPED HIS WABBLING FOOT AND MOTIONED US TO BE OFF WE OBEYED WITH ALACRITY FOR IT WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A DRUNKEN INDIAN
2691-156755-0033 AND GREATLY ALARMED US THE TEA MAY HAVE EASED JAKIE'S PAIN BUT IT DID NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE HAD HOPED
2691-156755-0034 AFTER THE LAWYER WENT AWAY GRANDMA TOLD US THAT JAKIE HAD WILLED US EACH FIFTY DOLLARS IN GOLD AND THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY TO GRANDPA AND HERSELF A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN THE SAP CEASED FLOWING TO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND THE YELLOW LEAVES WERE FALLING
2691-156755-0035 GRANDPA HAD THE GRAVE ENCLOSED WITH A WHITE PALING AND WE CHILDREN PLANTED CASTILIAN ROSE BUSHES AT THE HEAD AND FOOT OF THE MOUND AND CARRIED WATER TO THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND IN TIME THEIR BRANCHES MET AND THE GRAVE WAS A BED OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOMS
2691-156755-0036 ONE DAY AS I WAS RETURNING FROM IT WITH MY EMPTY PAIL A TIDY BLACK EYED WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID I'M A CHEROKEE INDIAN THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE THREE DROVERS THAT SOLD THE BRUNNERS THEM LONG HORNED CATTLE THAT WAS DELIVERED THE OTHER DAY
