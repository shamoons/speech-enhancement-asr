27-123349-0000 SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
27-123349-0001 BUT HE WAS PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A COMMITTEE
27-123349-0002 WHERE THE EXPEDITION SHOULD LAND TO APPOINT OFFICERS TO SUPERINTEND THE LEVYING OF TROOPS TO DOLE OUT PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL WAS TO DIRECT THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FIELD
27-123349-0003 AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
27-123349-0004 TAKEN AN IMPRESS FROM THE SOCIETY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AMBITIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED REVIVED IN HIS BOSOM HE REMEMBERED THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GREETED BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY
27-123349-0005 AND EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD NOW RISE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO WELCOME HIM HE REMEMBERED THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE SOLDIERS HAD ALWAYS BORNE HIM AND FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT THEY WOULD COME OVER TO HIM BY REGIMENTS
27-123349-0006 ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
27-123349-0007 THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
27-123349-0008 WILDMAN WHO LOVED TO TALK TREASON IN PARABLES SENT TO SAY THAT THE EARL OF RICHMOND JUST TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HAD LANDED IN ENGLAND WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN AND HAD A FEW DAYS LATER BEEN CROWNED ON THE FIELD OF BOSWORTH
27-123349-0009 ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM WAS TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT ASSUME THE REGAL TITLE
27-123349-0010 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
27-123349-0011 SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
27-123349-0012 WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
27-123349-0013 RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
27-123349-0014 A SUM SUFFICIENT FOR THE TWO EXPEDITIONS VERY LITTLE WAS OBTAINED FROM LONDON SIX THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THENCE BUT INSTEAD OF THE MONEY CAME EXCUSES FROM WILDMAN
27-123349-0015 BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
27-123349-0016 BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
27-123349-0017 BUT THIS WAS NOT EASY LOCKE HAD AT OXFORD ABSTAINED FROM EXPRESSING ANY OPINION ON THE POLITICS OF THE DAY SPIES HAD BEEN SET ABOUT HIM DOCTORS OF DIVINITY AND MASTERS OF ARTS
27-123349-0018 TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
27-123349-0019 THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
27-123349-0020 THE GOVERNMENT RESOLVED TO PUNISH HIM WITHOUT ONE ORDERS CAME FROM WHITEHALL THAT HE SHOULD BE EJECTED AND THOSE ORDERS THE DEAN AND CANONS MADE HASTE TO OBEY
27-123349-0021 LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
27-123349-0022 THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
27-123349-0023 BUT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT ARGYLE WOULD SHORTLY APPEAR IN ARMS AMONG HIS CLANSMEN A PROCLAMATION WAS ACCORDINGLY ISSUED DIRECTING THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO BE IN READINESS
27-123349-0024 ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
27-123349-0025 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0026 WHO HAD LONG RESIDED IN ENGLAND AS AMBASSADOR FROM THE UNITED PROVINCES AND EVERARD VAN DYKVELT WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES HAD BEEN SENT BY THE STATE GENERAL ON A SPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE AND CONGRATULATION
27-123349-0027 THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
27-123349-0028 WHOM NOTHING BUT THE SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD PREVENTED FROM COMMITTING A FOUL MURDER AND AMONG THEM WAS THE OWNER OF THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE BUTCHERY
27-123349-0029 ARGYLE HAS THE GREATEST MEANS OF ANNOYING ME AND OF ALL PLACES HOLLAND IS THAT WHENCE A BLOW MAY BE BEST AIMED AGAINST ME THE DUTCH ENVOYS ASSURED HIS MAJESTY THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID SHOULD INSTANTLY BE COMMUNICATED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0030 WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
27-123349-0031 JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
27-123349-0032 THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
27-123349-0033 BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
27-123349-0034 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES HAD NEVER BEEN DELIBERATELY REVISED AND PERFECTED IN A TIME OF TRANQUILLITY EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMONWEALTHS
27-123349-0035 WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0036 AS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES SO THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES
27-123349-0037 HOLLAND ALONE CONTAINED EIGHTEEN CITIES EACH OF WHICH WAS FOR MANY PURPOSES AN INDEPENDENT STATE JEALOUS OF ALL INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT IF THE RULERS OF SUCH A CITY RECEIVED FROM THE HAGUE AN ORDER
27-123349-0038 WHICH WAS UNPLEASING TO THEM THEY EITHER NEGLECTED IT ALTOGETHER OR EXECUTED IT LANGUIDLY AND TARDILY IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS INDEED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS ALL POWERFUL
27-123349-0039 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE WHERE THE BRITISH EXILES HAD CONGREGATED AND WHERE THEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN FITTED OUT WAS THE RICH AND POPULOUS AMSTERDAM AND THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM WERE THE HEADS OF THE FACTION HOSTILE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0040 AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
27-123349-0041 AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ANIMATED BY THEIR SPIRIT ALL THE ENDEAVOURS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT WHAT JAMES DESIRED WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE EVASIONS OF THE FUNCTIONARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND BY THE BLUNDERS OF COLONEL BEVIL SKELTON
27-123349-0042 THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
27-123349-0043 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0044 AND THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL WISH AT THE STADTHOUSE OF AMSTERDAM TO PREVENT ARGYLE FROM SAILING NO DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SKELTON NOW ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE STATES GENERAL THEY SHOWED EVERY DISPOSITION TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND
27-123349-0045 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
27-123349-0046 WAS DESPATCHED TO THE ADMIRALTY OF AMSTERDAM BUT THIS ORDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MISINFORMATION DID NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF THE SHIPS THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN THE TEXEL
27-123349-0047 WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
27-123349-0048 AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
27-123349-0049 AND ALLOWED TWO OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO GO ON SHORE THERE THE BISHOP ORDERED THEM TO BE ARRESTED THE REFUGEES PROCEEDED TO HOLD A LONG AND ANIMATED DEBATE ON THIS MISADVENTURE
27-123349-0050 FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
27-123349-0051 SOME WERE FOR PROCEEDING WITHOUT DELAY TO ARGYLESHIRE AT LAST THE EARL SEIZED SOME GENTLEMEN WHO LIVED NEAR THE COAST OF THE ISLAND AND PROPOSED TO THE BISHOP AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS THE BISHOP RETURNED NO ANSWER AND THE FLEET
27-123349-0052 AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
27-123349-0053 WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
27-123349-0054 THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0055 OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
27-123349-0056 HERE THE EARL PUBLISHED A MANIFESTO DRAWN UP IN HOLLAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMITTEE BY JAMES STEWART A SCOTCH ADVOCATE WHOSE PEN WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER EMPLOYED IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
27-123349-0057 IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
27-123349-0058 A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
