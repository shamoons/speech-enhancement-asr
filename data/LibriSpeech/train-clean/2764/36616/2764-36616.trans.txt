2764-36616-0000 WHICH WAS THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAY AND HOW COULD I NOT HAVE BEEN
2764-36616-0001 THIS MYSTERY PUZZLED ME FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY VIEWS I DRIFTED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER SOMETHING WAS OUT THERE THAT MUCH WAS CERTAIN AND ANY DOUBTING THOMAS WAS INVITED TO PLACE HIS FINGER ON THE SCOTIA'S WOUND WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK
2764-36616-0002 ALSO DISCREDITED WAS THE IDEA OF A FLOATING HULL OR SOME OTHER ENORMOUS WRECKAGE AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS SPEED OF MOVEMENT SO ONLY TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTION WERE LEFT CREATING TWO VERY DISTINCT GROUPS OF SUPPORTERS
2764-36616-0003 IT COULDN'T STAND UP TO INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN BOTH THE NEW WORLD AND THE OLD THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL HAD SUCH A MECHANISM AT HIS DISPOSAL WAS LESS THAN PROBABLE WHERE AND WHEN HAD HE BUILT IT AND HOW COULD HE HAVE BUILT IT IN SECRET
2764-36616-0004 ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
2764-36616-0005 AND THE TORPEDO HAS LED TO THIS UNDERWATER BATTERING RAM WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE WORLD PUTTING ITS FOOT DOWN AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS OF A WAR MACHINE COLLAPSED IN THE FACE OF FORMAL DENIALS FROM THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
2764-36616-0006 SINCE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WAS AT STAKE AND TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL WAS SUFFERING
2764-36616-0007 BESIDES HOW COULD THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAVE ESCAPED PUBLIC NOTICE KEEPING A SECRET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A NATION WHOSE EVERY MOVE IS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY RIVAL POWERS
2764-36616-0008 SO AFTER INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN ENGLAND FRANCE RUSSIA PRUSSIA SPAIN ITALY AMERICA AND EVEN TURKEY THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN UNDERWATER MONITOR WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED AND SO THE MONSTER SURFACED AGAIN
2764-36616-0009 DESPITE THE ENDLESS WITTICISMS HEAPED ON IT BY THE POPULAR PRESS
2764-36616-0010 AFTER I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK SEVERAL PEOPLE DID ME THE HONOR OF CONSULTING ME ON THE PHENOMENON IN QUESTION IN FRANCE I HAD PUBLISHED A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ENTITLED THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS WELL RECEIVED IN SCHOLARLY CIRCLES
2764-36616-0011 MY VIEWS WERE IN DEMAND
2764-36616-0012 I CONFINED MYSELF TO A FLAT NO COMMENT BUT SOON PINNED TO THE WALL I HAD TO EXPLAIN MYSELF STRAIGHT OUT AND IN THIS VEIN THE HONORABLE PIERRE ARONNAX PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM WAS SUMMONED BY THE NEW YORK HERALD TO FORMULATE HIS VIEWS NO MATTER WHAT
2764-36616-0013 I COMPLIED SINCE I COULD NO LONGER HOLD MY TONGUE I LET IT WAG I DISCUSSED THE QUESTION IN ITS EVERY ASPECT BOTH POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC AND THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE WELL PADDED ARTICLE I PUBLISHED IN THE ISSUE OF APRIL THIRTIETH
2764-36616-0014 THEREFORE I WROTE AFTER EXAMINING THESE DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES ONE BY ONE WE ARE FORCED EVERY OTHER SUPPOSITION HAVING BEEN REFUTED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL MARINE ANIMAL
2764-36616-0015 THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US NO SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE DISTANT DEPTHS WHAT CREATURES INHABIT OR COULD INHABIT THOSE REGIONS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
2764-36616-0016 WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THESE ANIMALS IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE HOWEVER THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SUBMITTED TO ME CAN TAKE THE FORM OF A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES EITHER WE KNOW EVERY VARIETY OF CREATURE POPULATING OUR PLANET OR WE DO NOT
2764-36616-0017 IF WE DO NOT KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM IF NATURE STILL KEEPS ICHTHYOLOGICAL SECRETS FROM US NOTHING IS MORE ADMISSIBLE THAN TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF FISH OR CETACEANS OF NEW SPECIES OR EVEN NEW GENERA ANIMALS WITH A BASICALLY CAST IRON CONSTITUTION
2764-36616-0018 THAT INHABIT STRATA BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR SOUNDINGS AND WHICH SOME DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AN URGE OR A WHIM IF YOU PREFER CAN BRING TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE OCEAN FOR LONG INTERVALS IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW EVERY LIVING SPECIES
2764-36616-0019 WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
2764-36616-0020 INCREASE ITS DIMENSIONS FIVEFOLD OR EVEN TENFOLD THEN GIVE THIS CETACEAN A STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE WHILE ENLARGING ITS OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND YOU HAVE THE ANIMAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT WOULD HAVE THE PROPORTIONS DETERMINED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHANNON
2764-36616-0021 THE INSTRUMENT NEEDED TO PERFORATE THE SCOTIA AND THE POWER TO PIERCE A STEAMER'S HULL IN ESSENCE THE NARWHALE IS ARMED WITH A SORT OF IVORY SWORD OR LANCE AS CERTAIN NATURALISTS HAVE EXPRESSED IT IT'S A KING SIZED TOOTH AS HARD AS STEEL
2764-36616-0022 WHICH THE NARWHALE ATTACKS WITH INVARIABLE SUCCESS OTHERS HAVE BEEN WRENCHED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
2764-36616-0023 OWNS ONE OF THESE TUSKS WITH A LENGTH OF TWO POINT TWO FIVE METERS AND A WIDTH AT ITS BASE OF FORTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS ALL RIGHT THEN IMAGINE THIS WEAPON TO BE TEN TIMES STRONGER AND THE ANIMAL TEN TIMES MORE POWERFUL
2764-36616-0024 LAUNCH IT AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR MULTIPLY ITS MASS TIMES ITS VELOCITY AND YOU GET JUST THE COLLISION WE NEED TO CAUSE THE SPECIFIED CATASTROPHE SO UNTIL INFORMATION BECOMES MORE ABUNDANT I PLUMP FOR A SEA UNICORN OF COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS
2764-36616-0025 NO LONGER ARMED WITH A MERE LANCE BUT WITH AN ACTUAL SPUR LIKE IRONCLAD FRIGATES OR THOSE WARSHIPS CALLED RAMS WHOSE MASS AND MOTOR POWER IT WOULD POSSESS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON IS THUS EXPLAINED AWAY
2764-36616-0026 THESE LAST WORDS WERE COWARDLY OF ME BUT AS FAR AS I COULD I WANTED TO PROTECT MY PROFESSORIAL DIGNITY AND NOT LAY MYSELF OPEN TO LAUGHTER FROM THE AMERICANS WHO WHEN THEY DO LAUGH LAUGH RAUCOUSLY
2764-36616-0027 I HAD LEFT MYSELF A LOOPHOLE YET DEEP DOWN I HAD ACCEPTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MONSTER MY ARTICLE WAS HOTLY DEBATED CAUSING A FINE OLD UPROAR
2764-36616-0028 MOREOVER THE SOLUTION IT PROPOSED ALLOWED FOR FREE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION THE HUMAN MIND ENJOYS IMPRESSIVE VISIONS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES NOW THEN THE SEA IS PRECISELY THEIR BEST MEDIUM
2764-36616-0029 OUR CREATOR CAST THEM USING A COLOSSAL MOLD THAT TIME HAS GRADUALLY MADE SMALLER WITH ITS UNTOLD DEPTHS COULDN'T THE SEA KEEP ALIVE SUCH HUGE SPECIMENS OF LIFE FROM ANOTHER AGE
2764-36616-0030 CONTINUOUS ALTERATION COULDN'T THE HEART OF THE OCEAN HIDE THE LAST REMAINING VARIETIES OF THESE TITANIC SPECIES FOR WHOM YEARS ARE CENTURIES AND CENTURIES MILLENNIA BUT I MUSTN'T LET THESE FANTASIES RUN AWAY WITH ME
2764-36616-0031 ENOUGH OF THESE FAIRY TALES THAT TIME HAS CHANGED FOR ME INTO HARSH REALITIES I REPEAT OPINION HAD CRYSTALLIZED AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THE PUBLIC ACCEPTED WITHOUT ARGUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF A PRODIGIOUS CREATURE THAT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FABLED SEA SERPENT
2764-36616-0032 YET IF SOME SAW IT PURELY AS A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED MORE PRACTICAL PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA AND ENGLAND WERE DETERMINED TO PURGE THE OCEAN OF THIS DAUNTING MONSTER TO INSURE THE SAFETY OF TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL
2764-36616-0033 THE SHIPPING AND MERCANTILE GAZETTE THE LLOYD'S LIST FRANCE'S PACKETBOAT AND MARITIME AND COLONIAL REVIEW ALL THE RAGS DEVOTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THREATENED TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUM RATES WERE UNANIMOUS ON THIS POINT
2764-36616-0034 THE NAVAL ARSENALS WERE UNLOCKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT WHO PRESSED ENERGETICALLY FORWARD WITH THE ARMING OF HIS FRIGATE BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS JUST WHEN A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO CHASE THE MONSTER THE MONSTER PUT IN NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
2764-36616-0035 FOR TWO MONTHS NOBODY HEARD A WORD ABOUT IT NOT A SINGLE SHIP ENCOUNTERED IT APPARENTLY THE UNICORN HAD GOTTEN WISE TO THESE PLOTS BEING WOVEN AROUND IT PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY BABBLING ABOUT THE CREATURE EVEN VIA THE ATLANTIC CABLE
2764-36616-0036 ACCORDINGLY THE WAGS CLAIMED THAT THIS SLIPPERY RASCAL HAD WAYLAID SOME PASSING TELEGRAM AND WAS MAKING THE MOST OF IT SO THE FRIGATE WAS EQUIPPED FOR A FAR OFF VOYAGE AND ARMED WITH FEARSOME FISHING GEAR BUT NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO STEER IT AND IMPATIENCE GREW UNTIL ON JUNE SECOND
2764-36616-0037 WORD CAME THAT THE TAMPICO A STEAMER ON THE SAN FRANCISCO LINE SAILING FROM CALIFORNIA TO SHANGHAI HAD SIGHTED THE ANIMAL AGAIN THREE WEEKS BEFORE IN THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC THIS NEWS CAUSED INTENSE EXCITEMENT
2764-36616-0038 NOT EVEN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BREATHER WAS GRANTED TO COMMANDER FARRAGUT HIS PROVISIONS WERE LOADED ON BOARD HIS COAL BUNKERS WERE OVERFLOWING NOT A CREWMAN WAS MISSING FROM HIS POST TO CAST OFF HE NEEDED ONLY TO FIRE AND STOKE HIS FURNACES HALF A DAY'S DELAY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE
