2764-36617-0000 CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER
2764-36617-0001 I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST THAT MY TRUE VOCATION MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO HUNT DOWN THIS DISTURBING MONSTER AND RID THE WORLD OF IT EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
2764-36617-0002 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND WITHOUT ANOTHER THOUGHT OF EXHAUSTION FRIENDS OR COLLECTIONS
2764-36617-0003 I ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER BESIDES I MUSED ALL ROADS LEAD HOME TO EUROPE AND OUR UNICORN MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TOWARD THE COAST OF FRANCE THAT FINE ANIMAL MAY EVEN LET ITSELF BE CAPTURED IN EUROPEAN SEAS AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME
2764-36617-0004 CONSEIL I CALLED IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT A DEVOTED LAD WHO WENT WITH ME ON ALL MY JOURNEYS A GALLANT FLEMISH BOY WHOM I GENUINELY LIKED AND WHO RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT A BORN STOIC PUNCTILIOUS ON PRINCIPLE
2764-36617-0005 HABITUALLY HARDWORKING RARELY STARTLED BY LIFE'S SURPRISES VERY SKILLFUL WITH HIS HANDS EFFICIENT IN HIS EVERY DUTY AND DESPITE HIS HAVING A NAME THAT MEANS COUNSEL NEVER GIVING ADVICE NOT EVEN THE UNSOLICITED KIND
2764-36617-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO IN CONSEIL I HAD A SEASONED SPECIALIST IN BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION AN ENTHUSIAST WHO COULD RUN WITH ACROBATIC AGILITY
2764-36617-0007 UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2764-36617-0008 WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
2764-36617-0009 FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS CONSEIL HAD GONE WITH ME WHEREVER SCIENCE BECKONED NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF A JOURNEY NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO
2764-36617-0010 NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT MOREOVER HE ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THAT DEFIED ALL AILMENTS OWNED SOLID MUSCLES BUT HADN'T A NERVE IN HIM NOT A SIGN OF NERVES THE MENTAL TYPE I MEAN
2764-36617-0011 THE LAD WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND HIS AGE TO THAT OF HIS EMPLOYER WAS AS FIFTEEN IS TO TWENTY PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING I HAD TURNED FORTY BUT CONSEIL HAD ONE FLAW HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY
2764-36617-0012 AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME CONSEIL I REPEATED WHILE FEVERISHLY BEGINNING MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE TO BE SURE I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEVOTED LAD
2764-36617-0013 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
2764-36617-0014 CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED
2764-36617-0015 YES MY BOY GET MY THINGS READY GET YOURS READY WE'RE DEPARTING IN TWO HOURS AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY WE HAVEN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS
2764-36617-0016 DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S COLLECTIONS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT THE ARCHAEOTHERIUM HYRACOTHERIUM OREODONTS CHEIROPOTAMUS AND MASTER'S OTHER FOSSIL SKELETONS
2764-36617-0017 CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR WHATEVER DETOUR MASTER WISHES OH IT'S NOTHING REALLY A ROUTE SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
2764-36617-0018 AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT THE AUTHOR OF A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
2764-36617-0019 IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
2764-36617-0020 THESE BEASTS CAN BE QUITE UNPREDICTABLE BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME FOR ANYTHING WHAT MASTER DOES I'LL DO CONSEIL REPLIED
2764-36617-0021 AS MASTER WISHES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER OUR TRUNKS WERE READY CONSEIL DID THEM IN A FLASH AND I WAS SURE THE LAD HADN'T MISSED A THING BECAUSE HE CLASSIFIED SHIRTS AND SUITS AS EXPERTLY AS BIRDS AND MAMMALS
2764-36617-0022 THE HOTEL ELEVATOR DROPPED US OFF IN THE MAIN VESTIBULE ON THE MEZZANINE I WENT DOWN A SHORT STAIR LEADING TO THE GROUND FLOOR
2764-36617-0023 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
2764-36617-0024 FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE
2764-36617-0025 THAT GREAT NEW YORK ANNEX LOCATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE EAST RIVER AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE ARRIVED AT THE WHARF NEXT TO WHICH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS VOMITING TORRENTS OF BLACK SMOKE FROM ITS TWO FUNNELS OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE
2764-36617-0026 I RUSHED ABOARD I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME
2764-36617-0027 THE SAME I REPLIED COMMANDER FARRAGUT IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU I BOWED AND LETTING THE COMMANDER ATTEND TO GETTING UNDER WAY I WAS TAKEN TO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ME
2764-36617-0028 THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN REACHED AN AVERAGE SPEED OF EIGHTEEN POINT THREE MILES PER HOUR A CONSIDERABLE SPEED BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH TO COPE WITH OUR GIGANTIC CETACEAN THE FRIGATE'S INTERIOR ACCOMMODATIONS COMPLEMENTED ITS NAUTICAL VIRTUES I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN
2764-36617-0029 WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED AS COMFORTABLE AS A HERMIT CRAB INSIDE THE SHELL OF A WHELK
2764-36617-0030 JUST THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS GIVING ORDERS TO CAST OFF THE LAST MOORINGS HOLDING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO ITS BROOKLYN PIER AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS
2764-36617-0031 THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE A SINGLE DAY
2764-36617-0032 AT THIS ORDER WHICH WAS RELAYED TO THE ENGINE BY MEANS OF A COMPRESSED AIR DEVICE THE MECHANICS ACTIVATED THE START UP WHEEL STEAM RUSHED WHISTLING INTO THE GAPING VALVES LONG HORIZONTAL PISTONS GROANED AND PUSHED THE TIE RODS OF THE DRIVE SHAFT
2764-36617-0033 THE BLADES OF THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH INCREASING SPEED AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN MOVED OUT MAJESTICALLY AMID A SPECTATOR LADEN ESCORT OF SOME ONE HUNDRED FERRIES AND TENDERS AUTHOR'S NOTE TENDERS ARE SMALL STEAMBOATS THAT ASSIST THE BIG LINERS
2764-36617-0034 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
2764-36617-0035 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
2764-36617-0036 THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
2764-36617-0037 WHOSE THIRTY NINE STARS GLEAMED FROM THE GAFF OF THE MIZZEN SAIL
2764-36617-0038 IT HUGGED THIS SAND COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
