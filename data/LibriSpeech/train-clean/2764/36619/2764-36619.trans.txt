2764-36619-0000 CHAPTER FIVE AT RANDOM FOR SOME WHILE THE VOYAGE OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS MARKED BY NO INCIDENT BUT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AROSE THAT DISPLAYED NED LAND'S MARVELOUS SKILLS AND SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE WE COULD PLACE IN HIM
2764-36619-0001 OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH THE FRIGATE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A FLEET OF AMERICAN WHALERS AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN THE NARWHALE BUT ONE OF THEM THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONROE
2764-36619-0002 ANXIOUS TO SEE NED LAND AT WORK COMMANDER FARRAGUT AUTHORIZED HIM TO MAKE HIS WAY ABOARD THE MONROE AND THE CANADIAN HAD SUCH GOOD LUCK THAT WITH A RIGHT AND LEFT SHOT HE HARPOONED NOT ONE WHALE BUT TWO STRIKING THE FIRST STRAIGHT TO THE HEART AND CATCHING THE OTHER AFTER A FEW MINUTES CHASE
2764-36619-0003 ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
2764-36619-0004 AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT
2764-36619-0005 NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ON JULY SIXTH FIFTEEN MILES SOUTH OF SHORE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DOUBLED THAT SOLITARY ISLET AT THE TIP OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT STRAY ROCK DUTCH SEAMEN HAD NAMED CAPE HORN AFTER THEIR HOMETOWN OF HOORN
2764-36619-0006 OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE EYES AND SPYGLASSES
2764-36619-0007 A BIT DAZZLED IT IS TRUE BY THE VISTA OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS DIDN'T REMAIN AT REST FOR AN INSTANT DAY AND NIGHT WE OBSERVED THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND THOSE WITH NYCTALOPIC EYES WHOSE ABILITY TO SEE IN THE DARK INCREASED THEIR CHANCES BY FIFTY PERCENT
2764-36619-0008 I NO LONGER LEFT THE SHIP'S DECK SOMETIMES BENDING OVER THE FORECASTLE RAILINGS SOMETIMES LEANING AGAINST THE STERNRAIL
2764-36619-0009 AND HOW MANY TIMES I SHARED THE EXCITEMENT OF GENERAL STAFF AND CREW WHEN SOME UNPREDICTABLE WHALE LIFTED ITS BLACKISH BACK ABOVE THE WAVES IN AN INSTANT THE FRIGATE'S DECK WOULD BECOME DENSELY POPULATED THE COWLS OVER THE COMPANIONWAYS WOULD VOMIT A TORRENT OF SAILORS AND OFFICERS
2764-36619-0010 WITH PANTING CHESTS AND ANXIOUS EYES WE EACH WOULD OBSERVE THE CETACEAN'S MOVEMENTS I STARED I STARED UNTIL I NEARLY WENT BLIND FROM A WORN OUT RETINA WHILE CONSEIL AS STOIC AS EVER KEPT REPEATING TO ME IN A CALM TONE
2764-36619-0011 IF MASTER'S EYES WOULD KINDLY STOP BULGING MASTER WILL SEE FARTHER BUT WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHANGE COURSE AND RACE AFTER THE ANIMAL SIGHTED ONLY TO FIND AN ORDINARY BALEEN WHALE
2764-36619-0012 OR A COMMON SPERM WHALE THAT SOON DISAPPEARED AMID A CHORUS OF CURSES HOWEVER THE WEATHER HELD GOOD OUR VOYAGE WAS PROCEEDING UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS BY THEN IT WAS THE BAD SEASON IN THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
2764-36619-0013 BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
2764-36619-0014 BUT THIS STUBBORN CANADIAN SPENT EIGHT HOURS OUT OF EVERY TWELVE READING OR SLEEPING IN HIS CABIN A HUNDRED TIMES I CHIDED HIM FOR HIS UNCONCERN BAH HE REPLIED NOTHING'S OUT THERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX
2764-36619-0015 AND IF THERE IS SOME ANIMAL WHAT CHANCE WOULD WE HAVE OF SPOTTING IT CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE JUST WANDERING AROUND AT RANDOM PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE SIGHTED THIS SLIPPERY BEAST AGAIN IN THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS I'M TRULY WILLING TO BELIEVE IT BUT TWO MONTHS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY SINCE THEN
2764-36619-0016 AND JUDGING BY YOUR NARWHALE'S PERSONALITY IT HATES GROWING MOLDY FROM HANGING OUT TOO LONG IN THE SAME WATERWAYS IT'S BLESSED WITH A TERRIFIC GIFT FOR GETTING AROUND NOW PROFESSOR YOU KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I THAT NATURE DOESN'T VIOLATE GOOD SENSE
2764-36619-0017 THESE BEARINGS DETERMINED THE FRIGATE TOOK A MORE DECISIVE WESTWARD HEADING AND TACKLED THE SEAS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC COMMANDER FARRAGUT FELT AND WITH GOOD REASON THAT IT WAS BEST TO STAY IN DEEP WATERS AND KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS
2764-36619-0018 NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM
2764-36619-0019 THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE THREATENING HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY
2764-36619-0020 NOBODY ATE NOBODY SLEPT TWENTY TIMES A DAY SOME ERROR IN PERCEPTION OR THE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS OF SOME SAILOR PERCHED IN THE CROSSTREES WOULD CAUSE INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND THIS EMOTION REPEATED TWENTY TIMES OVER
2764-36619-0021 KEPT US IN A STATE OF IRRITABILITY SO INTENSE THAT A REACTION WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW AND THIS REACTION WASN'T LONG IN COMING FOR THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH EACH DAY SEEMED LIKE A CENTURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLOWED ALL THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC
2764-36619-0022 RACING AFTER WHALES SIGHTED ABRUPTLY VEERING OFF COURSE SWERVING SHARPLY FROM ONE TACK TO ANOTHER STOPPING SUDDENLY PUTTING ON STEAM AND REVERSING ENGINES IN QUICK SUCCESSION AT THE RISK OF STRIPPING ITS GEARS
2764-36619-0023 AND IT DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT UNEXPLORED FROM THE BEACHES OF JAPAN TO THE COASTS OF AMERICA AND WE FOUND NOTHING NOTHING EXCEPT AN IMMENSENESS OF DESERTED WAVES NOTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A GIGANTIC NARWHALE OR AN UNDERWATER ISLET
2764-36619-0024 AND EACH MAN NOW WANTED ONLY TO CATCH UP ON HIS EATING AND SLEEPING TO MAKE UP FOR THE TIME HE HAD SO STUPIDLY SACRIFICED WITH TYPICAL HUMAN FICKLENESS THEY JUMPED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER INEVITABLY THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE UNDERTAKING BECAME ITS MOST ENERGETIC OPPONENTS
2764-36619-0025 THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
2764-36619-0026 NEVER HAD THE CREW OF AN AMERICAN NAVAL CRAFT SHOWN MORE PATIENCE AND ZEAL
2764-36619-0027 A REQUEST TO THIS EFFECT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMMANDER THE COMMANDER STOOD HIS GROUND HIS SAILORS COULDN'T HIDE THEIR DISCONTENT AND THEIR WORK SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT I'M UNWILLING TO SAY THAT THERE WAS MUTINY ON BOARD
2764-36619-0028 AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHART A COURSE TOWARD EUROPEAN SEAS THIS PROMISE WAS GIVEN ON NOVEMBER SECOND IT HAD THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF REVIVING THE CREW'S FAILING SPIRITS THE OCEAN WAS OBSERVED WITH RENEWED CARE
2764-36619-0029 EACH MAN WANTED ONE LAST LOOK WITH WHICH TO SUM UP HIS EXPERIENCE SPYGLASSES FUNCTIONED WITH FEVERISH ENERGY A SUPREME CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THE GIANT NARWHALE AND THE LATTER HAD NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR IGNORING THIS SUMMONS TO APPEAR
2764-36619-0030 TWO DAYS PASSED THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM
2764-36619-0031 A THOUSAND METHODS WERE USED TO SPARK ITS INTEREST OR ROUSE IT FROM ITS APATHY ENORMOUS SIDES OF BACON WERE TRAILED IN OUR WAKE TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION I MUST SAY OF ASSORTED SHARKS
2764-36619-0032 WHILE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEAVED TO ITS LONGBOATS RADIATED IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND IT AND DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT OF THE SEA UNEXPLORED BUT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER FOURTH ARRIVED WITH THIS UNDERWATER MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
2764-36619-0033 BY THEN THE FRIGATE LAY IN LATITUDE THIRTY ONE DEGREES FIFTEEN NORTH AND LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DEGREES FORTY TWO EAST THE SHORES OF JAPAN WERE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES TO OUR LEEWARD NIGHT WAS COMING ON EIGHT O'CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK
2764-36619-0034 HUGE CLOUDS COVERED THE MOON'S DISK THEN IN ITS FIRST QUARTER THE SEA UNDULATED PLACIDLY BENEATH THE FRIGATE'S STEMPOST JUST THEN I WAS IN THE BOW LEANING OVER THE STARBOARD RAIL CONSEIL STATIONED BESIDE ME STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD
2764-36619-0035 ROOSTING IN THE SHROUDS THE CREW EXAMINED THE HORIZON WHICH SHRANK AND DARKENED LITTLE BY LITTLE OFFICERS WERE PROBING THE INCREASING GLOOM WITH THEIR NIGHT GLASSES SOMETIMES THE MURKY OCEAN SPARKLED BENEATH MOONBEAMS THAT DARTED BETWEEN THE FRINGES OF TWO CLOUDS
2764-36619-0036 THEN ALL TRACES OF LIGHT VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS OBSERVING CONSEIL I DISCOVERED THAT JUST BARELY THE GALLANT LAD HAD FALLEN UNDER THE GENERAL INFLUENCE AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS NERVES WERE TWITCHING WITH CURIOSITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
2764-36619-0037 COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE
2764-36619-0038 IN MASTER'S LITTLE APARTMENT CONSEIL ANSWERED IN MASTER'S MUSEUM
2764-36619-0039 AND IT WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED EVERY CURIOSITY SEEKER IN TOWN QUITE SO CONSEIL AND WHAT'S MORE
2764-36619-0040 TO BE SURE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY I DO THINK THEY'LL HAVE FUN AT MASTER'S EXPENSE AND MUST IT BE SAID IT MUST BE SAID CONSEIL WELL THEN IT WILL SERVE MASTER RIGHT
2764-36619-0041 HOW TRUE WHEN ONE HAS THE HONOR OF BEING AN EXPERT AS MASTER IS ONE MUSTN'T LAY HIMSELF OPEN TO CONSEIL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COMPLETE THE COMPLIMENT IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL SILENCE A VOICE BECAME AUDIBLE
