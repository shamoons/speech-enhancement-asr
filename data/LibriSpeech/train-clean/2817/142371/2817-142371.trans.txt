2817-142371-0000 THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP BOOTS
2817-142371-0001 THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS
2817-142371-0002 HE PROFFERED VARIOUS CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES I SEE HIM MYSELF HE SAID I SEE HIM COMING ALONG BY THE CRAB TREE MEADOW ON A BALD FACED HOSS I'D JUST BEEN T HEV A PINT
2817-142371-0003 AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH TREE I SEE THE MAN TOP BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD FACED HOSS I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
2817-142371-0004 I SAYS FOR I WANTED TO HEAR THE TURN OF HIS TONGUE AS I MIGHT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS A THIS COUNTRY MAN SO I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR IT LL OLD HUP FOR THE BARLEY THIS MORNING I THINK THERE'LL BE A BIT GOT HIN IF WE'VE GOOD LUCK
2817-142371-0005 YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW
2817-142371-0006 I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
2817-142371-0007 AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
2817-142371-0008 THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN
2817-142371-0009 AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
2817-142371-0010 AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID
2817-142371-0011 SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
2817-142371-0012 AS IS A GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES
2817-142371-0013 FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
2817-142371-0014 THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
2817-142371-0015 IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
2817-142371-0016 AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
2817-142371-0017 THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
2817-142371-0018 SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
2817-142371-0019 WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
2817-142371-0020 AND YOU KEEP IT SO EXQUISITELY CLEAN MISSUS POYSER I LIKE THESE PREMISES DO YOU KNOW BEYOND ANY ON THE ESTATE WELL SIR SINCE YOU'RE FOND OF EM
2817-142371-0021 I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
2817-142371-0022 NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0023 ON ALL HANDS ABOUT YOUR FINE CHEESE AND BUTTER SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING POLITELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT THERE COULD BE ANY QUESTION ON WHICH HE AND MISSUS POYSER MIGHT HAPPEN TO DISAGREE I THINK I SEE THE DOOR OPEN THERE
2817-142371-0024 YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
2817-142371-0025 THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
2817-142371-0026 BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
2817-142371-0027 I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
2817-142371-0028 MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
2817-142371-0029 SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEATING HIMSELF ON A SMALL CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR DO YOU KNOW MISSUS POYSER SIT DOWN PRAY BOTH OF YOU I'VE BEEN FAR FROM CONTENTED FOR SOME TIME WITH MISSUS SATCHELL'S DAIRY MANAGEMENT
2817-142371-0030 I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
2817-142371-0031 POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH TONGUED PALAVER MISTER POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR
2817-142371-0032 AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
2817-142371-0033 SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
2817-142371-0034 NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
2817-142371-0035 YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
2817-142371-0036 INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
2817-142371-0037 I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
2817-142371-0038 NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0039 THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
2817-142371-0040 HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0041 HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
2817-142371-0042 MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN
2817-142371-0043 HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
2817-142371-0044 I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND
2817-142371-0045 BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
2817-142371-0046 NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
2817-142371-0047 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0048 THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
2817-142371-0049 WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
2817-142371-0050 WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN

2817-142371-0053 THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
2817-142371-0054 BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
2817-142371-0055 AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER

2817-142371-0057 EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
2817-142371-0058 WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
2817-142371-0059 WHEN MISSUS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK HOUSE THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK AS
2817-142371-0060 SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
2817-142371-0061 WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
2817-142371-0062 AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
2817-142371-0063 TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
2817-142371-0064 IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MISSUS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR
2817-142371-0065 FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
2817-142371-0066 AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
2817-142371-0067 FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
2817-142371-0068 AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
2817-142371-0069 FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL
2817-142371-0070 THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
2817-142371-0071 AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
2817-142371-0072 GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE ENTERED THE HOUSE THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MISTER POYSER
2817-142371-0073 A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0074 THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK

2817-142371-0077 THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MISSUS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT
2817-142371-0078 AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
