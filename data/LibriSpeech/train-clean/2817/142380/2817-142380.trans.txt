2817-142380-0000 WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0002 HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
2817-142380-0003 SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0005 YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
2817-142380-0006 IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007 WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0008 IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
2817-142380-0009 THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010 AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0011 AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
2817-142380-0012 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013 I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0014 I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
2817-142380-0015 TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016 HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0017 HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
2817-142380-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020 SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
2817-142380-0021 BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023 THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0024 EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0026 FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
2817-142380-0027 NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028 AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0029 HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
2817-142380-0030 NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031 AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0032 I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034 AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0035 AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
2817-142380-0036 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037 IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0038 IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2817-142380-0039 BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
2817-142380-0040 SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
2817-142380-0041 YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
2817-142380-0042 IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT
