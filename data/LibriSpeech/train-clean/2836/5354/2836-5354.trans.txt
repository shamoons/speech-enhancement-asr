2836-5354-0002 WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
2836-5354-0003 WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
