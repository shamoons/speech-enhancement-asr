2911-15084-0000 WOULD HAVE FORMED HIS CHRISTIAN EMPIRE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT ONE BY ONE THESE KINDRED PEOPLES WERE UPROOTED AND SWEPT AWAY WHILE THE NEIGHBORING ALGONQUINS TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN A BULWARK WERE INVOLVED WITH THEM IN A COMMON RUIN
2911-15084-0001 FROM WHOSE CONVERSION IT WAS VAIN TO LOOK FOR THE SAME SOLID AND DECISIVE RESULTS IN A MEASURE THE OCCUPATION OF THE JESUITS WAS GONE SOME OF THEM WENT HOME WELL RESOLVED WRITES THE FATHER SUPERIOR
2911-15084-0002 ABOUT TWENTY IN NUMBER SEVERAL SOON FELL VICTIMS TO FAMINE
2911-15084-0003 THE GUNS AND TOMAHAWKS OF THE IROQUOIS WERE THE RUIN OF THEIR HOPES COULD THEY HAVE CURBED OR CONVERTED THOSE FEROCIOUS BANDS IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN CERTAIN
2911-15084-0004 SAVAGES TAMED NOT CIVILIZED FOR THAT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE VALLEYS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND THE MISSISSIPPI RULED BY PRIESTS IN THE INTEREST OF CATHOLICITY AND OF FRANCE
2911-15084-0005 UNMOLESTED BY INDIAN ENEMIES AND FED BY A RICH COMMERCE SHE WOULD HAVE PUT FORTH A VIGOROUS GROWTH TRUE TO HER FAR REACHING AND ADVENTUROUS GENIUS SHE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE WEST WITH TRADERS SETTLERS AND GARRISONS
2911-15084-0006 WHILE AS YET THE COLONIES OF ENGLAND WERE BUT A WEAK AND BROKEN LINE ALONG THE SHORE OF THE ATLANTIC AND WHEN AT LAST THE GREAT CONFLICT CAME ENGLAND AND LIBERTY WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED
2911-15084-0007 NOT BY A DEPLETED ANTAGONIST STILL FEEBLE FROM THE EXHAUSTION OF A STARVED AND PERSECUTED INFANCY BUT BY AN ATHLETIC CHAMPION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RICHELIEU AND OF LOYOLA LIBERTY MAY THANK THE IROQUOIS THAT BY THEIR INSENSATE FURY
2911-15084-0008 AND A PERIL AND A WOE AVERTED FROM HER FUTURE THEY RUINED THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE LIFE BLOOD OF NEW FRANCE THEY STOPPED THE CURRENT OF HER ARTERIES AND MADE ALL HER EARLY YEARS A MISERY AND A TERROR NOT THAT THEY CHANGED HER DESTINIES
2911-15084-0009 THE CONTEST ON THIS CONTINENT BETWEEN LIBERTY AND ABSOLUTISM WAS NEVER DOUBTFUL BUT THE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEARLY BOUGHT AND THE DOWNFALL OF THE OTHER INCOMPLETE
2911-15084-0010 POPULATIONS FORMED IN THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF A FEUDAL MONARCHY AND CONTROLLED BY A HIERARCHY PROFOUNDLY HOSTILE TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE REMAINED A HINDRANCE AND A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF THAT MAJESTIC EXPERIMENT
