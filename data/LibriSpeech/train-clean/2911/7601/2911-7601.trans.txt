2911-7601-0000 TRUE NERVOUS VERY VERY DREADFULLY NERVOUS I HAD BEEN AND AM BUT WHY WILL YOU SAY THAT I AM MAD THE DISEASE HAD SHARPENED MY SENSES NOT DESTROYED NOT DULLED THEM
2911-7601-0001 ABOVE ALL WAS THE SENSE OF HEARING ACUTE I HEARD ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVEN
2911-7601-0002 I HEARD MANY THINGS IN HELL HOW THEN AM I MAD HEARKEN AND OBSERVE HOW HEALTHILY HOW CALMLY I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW FIRST THE IDEA ENTERED MY BRAIN BUT ONCE CONCEIVED
2911-7601-0003 IT HAUNTED ME DAY AND NIGHT OBJECT THERE WAS NONE PASSION THERE WAS NONE I LOVED THE OLD MAN HE HAD NEVER WRONGED ME HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ME INSULT FOR HIS GOLD I HAD NO DESIRE I THINK IT WAS HIS EYE
2911-7601-0004 YES IT WAS THIS HE HAD THE EYE OF A VULTURE A PALE BLUE EYE WITH A FILM OVER IT WHENEVER IT FELL UPON ME MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND SO BY DEGREES VERY GRADUALLY
2911-7601-0005 I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
2911-7601-0006 WITH WHAT CAUTION WITH WHAT FORESIGHT WITH WHAT DISSIMULATION I WENT TO WORK I WAS NEVER KINDER TO THE OLD MAN THAN DURING THE WHOLE WEEK BEFORE I KILLED HIM AND EVERY NIGHT ABOUT MIDNIGHT I TURNED THE LATCH OF HIS DOOR AND OPENED IT
2911-7601-0007 OH SO GENTLY AND THEN WHEN I HAD MADE AN OPENING SUFFICIENT FOR MY HEAD I PUT IN A DARK LANTERN ALL CLOSED CLOSED THAT NO LIGHT SHONE OUT AND THEN I THRUST IN MY HEAD
2911-7601-0008 OH YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO SEE HOW CUNNINGLY I THRUST IT IN I MOVED IT SLOWLY VERY VERY SLOWLY SO THAT I MIGHT NOT DISTURB THE OLD MAN'S SLEEP IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO PLACE MY WHOLE HEAD WITHIN THE OPENING
2911-7601-0009 SO FAR THAT I COULD SEE HIM AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED HA WOULD A MADMAN HAVE BEEN SO WISE AS THIS AND THEN WHEN MY HEAD WAS WELL IN THE ROOM I UNDID THE LANTERN CAUTIOUSLY OH SO CAUTIOUSLY
2911-7601-0010 FOR IT WAS NOT THE OLD MAN WHO VEXED ME BUT HIS EVIL EYE AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE DAY BROKE I WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CHAMBER AND SPOKE COURAGEOUSLY TO HIM CALLING HIM BY NAME IN A HEARTY TONE AND INQUIRING HOW HE HAS PASSED THE NIGHT
2911-7601-0011 SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
2911-7601-0012 NEVER BEFORE THAT NIGHT HAD I FELT THE EXTENT OF MY OWN POWERS OF MY SAGACITY I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MY FEELINGS OF TRIUMPH TO THINK THAT THERE I WAS OPENING THE DOOR LITTLE BY LITTLE
2911-7601-0013 AND HE NOT EVEN TO DREAM OF MY SECRET DEEDS OR THOUGHTS I FAIRLY CHUCKLED AT THE IDEA AND PERHAPS HE HEARD ME FOR HE MOVED ON THE BED SUDDENLY AS IF STARTLED NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT I DREW BACK BUT NO
2911-7601-0014 HIS ROOM WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH WITH THE THICK DARKNESS FOR THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSE FASTENED THROUGH FEAR OF ROBBERS AND SO I KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
2911-7601-0015 STEADILY I HAD MY HEAD IN AND WAS ABOUT TO OPEN THE LANTERN WHEN MY THUMB SLIPPED UPON THE TIN FASTENING AND THE OLD MAN SPRANG UP IN BED CRYING OUT WHO'S THERE I KEPT QUITE STILL AND SAID NOTHING
2911-7601-0016 FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
2911-7601-0017 PRESENTLY I HEARD A SLIGHT GROAN AND I KNEW IT WAS THE GROAN OF MORTAL TERROR IT WAS NOT A GROAN OF PAIN OR OF GRIEF OH NO
2911-7601-0018 WHEN OVERCHARGED WITH AWE I KNEW THE SOUND WELL MANY A NIGHT JUST AT MIDNIGHT WHEN ALL THE WORLD SLEPT
2911-7601-0019 DEEPENING WITH ITS DREADFUL ECHO THE TERRORS THAT DISTRACTED ME I SAY I KNEW IT WELL I KNEW WHAT THE OLD MAN FELT AND PITIED HIM ALTHOUGH I CHUCKLED AT HEART
2911-7601-0020 WHEN HE HAD TURNED IN THE BED HIS FEARS HAD BEEN EVER SINCE GROWING UPON HIM HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO FANCY THEM CAUSELESS BUT COULD NOT HE HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIMSELF IT IS NOTHING BUT THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY
2911-7601-0021 IT IS ONLY A MOUSE CROSSING THE FLOOR OR IT IS MERELY A CRICKET WHICH HAS MADE A SINGLE CHIRP YES HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THESE SUPPOSITIONS BUT HE HAD FOUND ALL IN VAIN ALL IN VAIN BECAUSE DEATH
2911-7601-0022 IN APPROACHING HIM HAD STALKED WITH HIS BLACK SHADOW BEFORE HIM AND ENVELOPED THE VICTIM AND IT WAS THE MOURNFUL INFLUENCE OF THE UNPERCEIVED SHADOW THAT CAUSED HIM TO FEEL ALTHOUGH HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD TO FEEL THE PRESENCE OF MY HEAD WITHIN THE ROOM
2911-7601-0023 WHEN I HAD WAITED A LONG TIME VERY PATIENTLY WITHOUT HEARING HIM LIE DOWN I RESOLVED TO OPEN A LITTLE A VERY VERY LITTLE CREVICE IN THE LANTERN SO I OPENED IT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW STEALTHILY
2911-7601-0024 STEALTHILY UNTIL AT LENGTH A SIMPLE DIM RAY LIKE THE THREAD OF THE SPIDER
2911-7601-0025 AND FELL FULL UPON THE VULTURE EYE IT WAS OPEN WIDE WIDE OPEN AND I GREW FURIOUS AS I GAZED UPON IT I SAW IT WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS ALL A DULL BLUE
2911-7601-0026 WITH A HIDEOUS VEIL OVER IT THAT CHILLED THE VERY MARROW IN MY BONES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE OR PERSON FOR I HAD DIRECTED THE RAY AS IF BY INSTINCT PRECISELY UPON THE DAMNED SPOT
2911-7601-0027 AND HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT WHAT YOU MISTAKE FOR MADNESS IS BUT OVER ACUTENESS OF THE SENSE NOW I SAY THERE CAME TO MY EARS
2911-7601-0028 SUCH AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I KNEW THAT SOUND WELL TOO IT WAS THE BEATING OF THE OLD MAN'S HEART IT INCREASED MY FURY AS THE BEATING OF A DRUM STIMULATES THE SOLDIER INTO COURAGE
2911-7601-0029 BUT EVEN YET I REFRAINED AND KEPT STILL I SCARCELY BREATHED I HELD THE LANTERN MOTIONLESS I TRIED HOW STEADILY I COULD MAINTAIN THE RAY
2911-7601-0030 MEANTIME THE HELLISH TATTOO OF THE HEART INCREASED IT GREW QUICKER AND QUICKER AND LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY INSTANT THE OLD MAN'S TERROR MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREME IT GREW LOUDER I SAY LOUDER EVERY MOMENT
2911-7601-0031 DO YOU MARK ME WELL I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I AM NERVOUS SO I AM AND NOW AT THE DEAD HOUR OF THE NIGHT AMID THE DREADFUL SILENCE OF THAT OLD HOUSE SO STRANGE A NOISE AS THIS EXCITED ME TO UNCONTROLLABLE TERROR
2911-7601-0032 YET FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER I REFRAINED AND STOOD STILL BUT THE BEATING GREW LOUDER LOUDER I THOUGHT THE HEART MUST BURST AND NOW A NEW ANXIETY SEIZED ME THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR THE OLD MAN'S HOUR HAD COME
2911-7601-0033 WITH A LOUD YELL I THREW OPEN THE LANTERN AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM HE SHRIEKED ONCE ONCE ONLY IN AN INSTANT I DRAGGED HIM TO THE FLOOR
2911-7601-0034 TO FIND THE DEED SO FAR DONE BUT FOR MANY MINUTES THE HEART BEAT ON WITH A MUFFLED SOUND THIS HOWEVER DID NOT VEX ME IT WOULD NOT BE HEARD THROUGH THE WALL AT LENGTH IT CEASED THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD
2911-7601-0035 I REMOVED THE BED AND EXAMINED THE CORPSE YES HE WAS STONE STONE DEAD I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE HEART AND HELD IT THERE MANY MINUTES THERE WAS NO PULSATION HE WAS STONE DEAD HIS EYE WOULD TROUBLE ME NO MORE
2911-7601-0036 IF STILL YOU THINK ME MAD YOU WILL THINK SO NO LONGER WHEN I DESCRIBE THE WISE PRECAUTIONS I TOOK FOR THE CONCEALMENT OF THE BODY THE NIGHT WANED AND I WORKED HASTILY BUT IN SILENCE FIRST OF ALL I DISMEMBERED THE CORPSE I CUT OFF THE HEAD
2911-7601-0037 AND DEPOSITED ALL BETWEEN THE SCANTLINGS I THEN REPLACED THE BOARDS SO CLEVERLY SO CUNNINGLY THAT NO HUMAN EYE NOT EVEN HIS COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY THING WRONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO WASH OUT NO STAIN OF ANY KIND
2911-7601-0038 NO BLOOD SPOT WHATEVER I HAD BEEN TOO WARY FOR THAT A TUB HAD CAUGHT ALL HA HA
2911-7601-0039 IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK STILL DARK AS MIDNIGHT AS THE BELL SOUNDED THE HOUR THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE STREET DOOR I WENT DOWN TO OPEN IT WITH A LIGHT HEART FOR WHAT HAD I NOW TO FEAR THERE ENTERED THREE MEN WHO INTRODUCED THEMSELVES
2911-7601-0040 WITH PERFECT SUAVITY AS OFFICERS OF THE POLICE A SHRIEK HAD BEEN HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR DURING THE NIGHT SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY HAD BEEN AROUSED INFORMATION HAD BEEN LODGED AT THE POLICE OFFICE AND THEY THE OFFICERS
2911-7601-0041 HAD BEEN DEPUTED TO SEARCH THE PREMISES I SMILED FOR WHAT HAD I TO FEAR I BADE THE GENTLEMEN WELCOME THE SHRIEK I SAID WAS MY OWN IN A DREAM THE OLD MAN I MENTIONED WAS ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY
2911-7601-0042 I TOOK MY VISITORS ALL OVER THE HOUSE I BADE THEM SEARCH SEARCH WELL I LED THEM AT LENGTH TO HIS CHAMBER I SHOWED THEM HIS TREASURES SECURE UNDISTURBED IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY CONFIDENCE
2911-7601-0043 PLACED MY OWN SEAT UPON THE VERY SPOT BENEATH WHICH REPOSED THE CORPSE OF THE VICTIM THE OFFICERS WERE SATISFIED MY MANNER HAD CONVINCED THEM I WAS SINGULARLY AT EASE THEY SAT AND WHILE I ANSWERED CHEERILY
2911-7601-0044 THEY CHATTED OF FAMILIAR THINGS BUT ERE LONG I FELT MYSELF GETTING PALE AND WISHED THEM GONE MY HEAD ACHED AND I FANCIED A RINGING IN MY EARS BUT STILL THEY SAT AND STILL CHATTED THE RINGING BECAME MORE DISTINCT IT CONTINUED
2911-7601-0045 AND BECAME MORE DISTINCT I TALKED MORE FREELY TO GET RID OF THE FEELING BUT IT CONTINUED AND GAINED DEFINITENESS UNTIL AT LENGTH I FOUND THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT WITHIN MY EARS NO DOUBT I NOW GREW VERY PALE BUT I TALKED MORE FLUENTLY
2911-7601-0046 AND WITH A HEIGHTENED VOICE YET THE SOUND INCREASED AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A LOW DULL QUICK SOUND MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I GASPED FOR BREATH AND YET THE OFFICERS HEARD IT NOT
2911-7601-0047 I TALKED MORE QUICKLY MORE VEHEMENTLY BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED I AROSE AND ARGUED ABOUT TRIFLES IN A HIGH KEY AND WITH VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE GONE
2911-7601-0048 I PACED THE FLOOR TO AND FRO WITH HEAVY STRIDES AS IF EXCITED TO FURY BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE MEN BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED OH GOD WHAT COULD I DO I FOAMED I RAVED I SWORE
2911-7601-0049 I SWUNG THE CHAIR UPON WHICH I HAD BEEN SITTING AND GRATED IT UPON THE BOARDS BUT THE NOISE AROSE OVER ALL AND CONTINUALLY INCREASED IT GREW LOUDER LOUDER LOUDER AND STILL THE MEN CHATTED PLEASANTLY AND SMILED
2911-7601-0050 WAS IT POSSIBLE THEY HEARD NOT ALMIGHTY GOD NO NO THEY HEARD THEY SUSPECTED THEY KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A MOCKERY OF MY HORROR THIS I THOUGHT AND THIS I THINK
2911-7601-0051 BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THIS AGONY ANYTHING WAS MORE TOLERABLE THAN THIS DERISION I COULD BEAR THOSE HYPOCRITICAL SMILES NO LONGER I FELT THAT I MUST SCREAM OR DIE AND NOW AGAIN HARK LOUDER LOUDER
