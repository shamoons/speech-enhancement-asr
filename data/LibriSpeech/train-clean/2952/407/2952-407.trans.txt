2952-407-0000 EVEN TO DAY IN THE COURTS OF CERTAIN JAPANESE TEMPLES YOU MAY SEE HEAPS OF OLD BRONZE MIRRORS CONTRIBUTED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF THIS KIND THAT I EVER SAW WAS IN THE COURT OF A TEMPLE OF THE JODO SECT AT HAKATA IN KYUSHU
2952-407-0001 WHO PRESENTED HER MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE TO BE USED FOR BELL METAL BUT AFTERWARDS SHE MUCH REGRETTED HER MIRROR SHE REMEMBERED THINGS THAT HER MOTHER HAD TOLD HER ABOUT IT AND SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD BELONGED NOT ONLY TO HER MOTHER BUT TO HER MOTHER'S MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND SHE REMEMBERED SOME HAPPY SMILES WHICH IT HAD REFLECTED
2952-407-0002 BUT SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY NECESSARY WHENEVER SHE WENT TO THE TEMPLE SHE SAW HER MIRROR LYING IN THE COURT YARD BEHIND A RAILING AMONG HUNDREDS OF OTHER MIRRORS HEAPED THERE TOGETHER SHE KNEW IT BY THE SHO CHIKU BAI IN RELIEF ON THE BACK OF IT THOSE THREE FORTUNATE EMBLEMS OF PINE BAMBOO AND PLUMFLOWER
2952-407-0003 WHICH DELIGHTED HER BABY EYES WHEN HER MOTHER FIRST SHOWED HER THE MIRROR SHE LONGED FOR SOME CHANCE TO STEAL THE MIRROR AND HIDE IT THAT SHE MIGHT THEREAFTER TREASURE IT ALWAYS BUT THE CHANCE DID NOT COME AND SHE BECAME VERY UNHAPPY FELT AS IF SHE HAD FOOLISHLY GIVEN AWAY A PART OF HER LIFE
2952-407-0004 A SAYING MYSTICALLY EXPRESSED BY THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR SOUL UPON THE BACKS OF MANY BRONZE MIRRORS AND SHE FEARED THAT IT WAS TRUE IN WEIRDER WAYS THAN SHE HAD BEFORE IMAGINED BUT SHE COULD NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF HER PAIN TO ANYBODY
2952-407-0005 EVIDENTLY THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN THAT MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE MUST HAVE REGRETTED THE GIVING SHE HAD NOT PRESENTED HER OFFERING WITH ALL HER HEART AND THEREFORE HER SELFISH SOUL REMAINING ATTACHED TO THE MIRROR KEPT IT HARD AND COLD IN THE MIDST OF THE FURNACE
2952-407-0006 OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
2952-407-0007 AFTER HAVING WRITTEN A FAREWELL LETTER CONTAINING THESE WORDS WHEN I AM DEAD IT WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT TO MELT THE MIRROR AND TO CAST THE BELL BUT TO THE PERSON WHO BREAKS THAT BELL BY RINGING IT GREAT WEALTH WILL BE GIVEN BY THE GHOST OF ME
2952-407-0008 BUT THE BELL PROVED TO BE A GOOD BELL AND IT BRAVELY WITHSTOOD THEIR ASSAULTS NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED DAY AFTER DAY AT ALL HOURS THEY CONTINUED TO RING THE BELL FURIOUSLY CARING NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE PROTESTS OF THE PRIESTS
2952-407-0009 SO THE RINGING BECAME AN AFFLICTION AND THE PRIESTS COULD NOT ENDURE IT AND THEY GOT RID OF THE BELL BY ROLLING IT DOWN THE HILL INTO A SWAMP THE SWAMP WAS DEEP AND SWALLOWED IT UP AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE BELL
2952-407-0010 OR BELL OF MUGEN NOW THERE ARE QUEER OLD JAPANESE BELIEFS IN THE MAGICAL EFFICACY OF A CERTAIN MENTAL OPERATION IMPLIED THOUGH NOT DESCRIBED BY THE VERB
2952-407-0011 THE WORD ITSELF CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY RENDERED BY ANY ENGLISH WORD FOR IT IS USED IN RELATION TO MANY KINDS OF MIMETIC MAGIC AS WELL AS IN RELATION TO THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY RELIGIOUS ACTS OF FAITH
2952-407-0012 TO COMPARE TO LIKEN BUT THE ESOTERIC MEANING IS TO SUBSTITUTE IN IMAGINATION ONE OBJECT OR ACTION FOR ANOTHER SO AS TO BRING ABOUT SOME MAGICAL OR MIRACULOUS RESULT
2952-407-0013 FOR EXAMPLE YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO BUILD A BUDDHIST TEMPLE BUT YOU CAN EASILY LAY A PEBBLE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA WITH THE SAME PIOUS FEELING THAT WOULD PROMPT YOU TO BUILD A TEMPLE IF YOU WERE RICH ENOUGH TO BUILD ONE THE MERIT OF SO OFFERING THE PEBBLE BECOMES EQUAL OR ALMOST EQUAL TO THE MERIT OF ERECTING A TEMPLE
2952-407-0014 YOU CANNOT READ THE SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE VOLUMES OF THE BUDDHIST TEXTS BUT YOU CAN MAKE A REVOLVING LIBRARY CONTAINING THEM TURN ROUND BY PUSHING IT LIKE A WINDLASS
2952-407-0015 SO MUCH WILL PERHAPS SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN THE RELIGIOUS MEANINGS OF NAZORAERU THE MAGICAL MEANINGS COULD NOT ALL BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT A GREAT VARIETY OF EXAMPLES BUT FOR PRESENT PURPOSES THE FOLLOWING WILL SERVE IF YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE MAN OF STRAW
2952-407-0016 FOR THE SAME REASON THAT SISTER HELEN MADE A LITTLE MAN OF WAX AND NAIL IT
2952-407-0017 THAT WOULD ILLUSTRATE ONE SIGNIFICATION OF NAZORAERU OR LET US SUPPOSE THAT A ROBBER HAS ENTERED YOUR HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT AND CARRIED AWAY YOUR VALUABLES IF YOU CAN DISCOVER THE FOOTPRINTS OF THAT ROBBER IN YOUR GARDEN AND THEN PROMPTLY BURN A VERY LARGE MOXA ON EACH OF THEM
2952-407-0018 THE SOLES OF THE FEET OF THE ROBBER WILL BECOME INFLAMED AND WILL ALLOW HIM NO REST UNTIL HE RETURNS OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO PUT HIMSELF AT YOUR MERCY THAT IS ANOTHER KIND OF MIMETIC MAGIC EXPRESSED BY THE TERM NAZORAERU
2952-407-0019 AFTER THE BELL HAD BEEN ROLLED INTO THE SWAMP THERE WAS OF COURSE NO MORE CHANCE OF RINGING IT IN SUCH WISE AS TO BREAK IT
2952-407-0020 BUT PERSONS WHO REGRETTED THIS LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY WOULD STRIKE AND BREAK OBJECTS IMAGINATIVELY SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BELL THUS HOPING TO PLEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE OWNER OF THE MIRROR THAT HAD MADE SO MUCH TROUBLE ONE OF THESE PERSONS WAS A WOMAN CALLED UMEGAE
2952-407-0021 WHILE THE PAIR WERE TRAVELING TOGETHER KAJIWARA ONE DAY FOUND HIMSELF IN GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF MONEY AND UMEGAE REMEMBERING THE TRADITION OF THE BELL OF MUGEN TOOK A BASIN OF BRONZE AND MENTALLY REPRESENTING IT TO BE THE BELL BEAT UPON IT UNTIL SHE BROKE IT
2952-407-0022 CRYING OUT AT THE SAME TIME FOR THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD A GUEST OF THE INN WHERE THE PAIR WERE STOPPING
2952-407-0023 AFTERWARDS A SONG WAS MADE ABOUT UMEGAE'S BASIN OF BRONZE AND THAT SONG IS SUNG BY DANCING GIRLS EVEN TO THIS DAY UMEGAE NO CHOZUBACHI TATAITE
2952-407-0024 IF BY STRIKING UPON THE WASH BASIN OF UMEGAE I COULD MAKE HONORABLE MONEY COME TO ME
2952-407-0025 BECAME GREAT AND MANY PEOPLE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF UMEGAE THEREBY HOPING TO EMULATE HER LUCK
2952-407-0026 AS IT DESERVES TO BE ANSWERED TAKE THEREFORE THIS JAR SO SAYING SHE PUT THE JAR INTO HIS HANDS AND DISAPPEARED INTO HIS HOUSE THE HAPPY MAN RUSHED TO TELL HIS WIFE THE GOOD NEWS HE SET DOWN IN FRONT OF HER THE COVERED JAR WHICH WAS HEAVY
2952-407-0027 AND THEY OPENED IT TOGETHER AND THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS FILLED UP TO THE VERY BRIM WITH
