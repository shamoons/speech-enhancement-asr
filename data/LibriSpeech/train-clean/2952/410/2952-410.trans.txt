2952-410-0000 ALL THE CAPACITIES OF A DARING AND SKILLFUL SOLDIER
2952-410-0001 BUT AS HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT DISTINCTION FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALONE AND AS HIS HEART REMAINED TRUE TO HIS FORMER LORD HE PREFERRED TO GIVE UP THE WORLD SO HE CUT OFF HIS HAIR AND BECAME A TRAVELING PRIEST TAKING THE BUDDHIST NAME OF KWAIRYO
2952-410-0002 AS IN OTHER YEARS HE HAD LAUGHED AT PERIL SO NOW ALSO HE SCORNED DANGER
2952-410-0003 SO HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND HAVING FOUND A SUITABLE GRASSY SPOT BY THE ROADSIDE HE LAY DOWN THERE AND PREPARED TO SLEEP
2952-410-0004 HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
2952-410-0005 SCARCELY HAD HE LAIN DOWN WHEN A MAN CAME ALONG THE ROAD CARRYING AN AXE AND A GREAT BUNDLE OF CHOPPED WOOD THIS WOODCUTTER HALTED ON SEEING KWAIRYO LYING DOWN
2952-410-0006 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT OBSERVATION SAID TO HIM IN A TONE OF GREAT SURPRISE WHAT KIND OF A MAN CAN YOU BE GOOD SIR THAT YOU DARE TO LIE DOWN ALONE IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THERE ARE HAUNTERS ABOUT HERE MANY OF THEM ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF HAIRY THINGS
2952-410-0007 MY FRIEND CHEERFULLY ANSWERED KWAIRYO I AM ONLY A WANDERING PRIEST A CLOUD AND WATER GUEST AS FOLKS CALL IT
2952-410-0008 AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
2952-410-0009 TO LIE DOWN HERE THIS PLACE HAS A BAD NAME A VERY BAD NAME BUT AS THE PROVERB HAS IT KUNSHI AYAYUKI NI CHIKAYORAZU THE SUPERIOR MAN DOES NOT NEEDLESSLY EXPOSE HIMSELF TO PERIL
2952-410-0010 AND I MUST ASSURE YOU SIR THAT IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SLEEP HERE THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MY HOUSE IS ONLY A WRETCHED THATCHED HUT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME AT ONCE IN THE WAY OF FOOD I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT THERE IS A ROOF AT LEAST AND YOU CAN SLEEP UNDER IT WITHOUT RISK
2952-410-0011 ACCEPTED THIS MODEST OFFER THE WOODCUTTER GUIDED HIM ALONG A NARROW PATH LEADING UP FROM THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH MOUNTAIN FOREST IT WAS A ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PATH SOMETIMES SKIRTING PRECIPICES SOMETIMES OFFERING NOTHING BUT A NETWORK OF
2952-410-0012 SLIPPERY ROOTS FOR THE FOOT TO REST UPON SOMETIMES WINDING OVER OR BETWEEN MASSES OF JAGGED ROCK BUT AT LAST KWAIRYO FOUND HIMSELF UPON A CLEARED SPACE AT THE TOP OF A HILL WITH A FULL MOON SHINING OVERHEAD AND HE SAW BEFORE HIM A SMALL THATCHED COTTAGE
2952-410-0013 AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY SOME ONE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RULES OF PROPRIETY THEN TURNING TO HIS HOST THE ARUJI OR HOUSE MASTER AS THE OTHERS CALLED HIM KWAIRYO SAID
2952-410-0014 FROM THE KINDNESS OF YOUR SPEECH AND FROM THE VERY POLITE WELCOME GIVEN ME BY YOUR HOUSEHOLD I IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN A WOODCUTTER PERHAPS YOU FORMERLY BELONGED TO ONE OF THE UPPER CLASSES SMILING THE WOODCUTTER ANSWERED SIR YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN
2952-410-0015 THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
2952-410-0016 BUT I LOVED WOMEN AND WINE TOO WELL AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION I ACTED WICKEDLY
2952-410-0017 RETRIBUTION FOLLOWED ME AND I LONG REMAINED A FUGITIVE IN THE LAND NOW I OFTEN PRAY THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ATONEMENT FOR THE EVIL WHICH I DID AND TO REESTABLISH THE ANCESTRAL HOME BUT I FEAR THAT I SHALL NEVER FIND ANY WAY OF SO DOING
2952-410-0018 KWAIRYO WAS PLEASED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOOD RESOLVE AND HE SAID TO THE ARUJI MY FRIEND I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE THAT MAN PRONE TO FOLLY IN THEIR YOUTH MAY IN AFTER YEARS BECOME VERY EARNEST IN RIGHT LIVING
2952-410-0019 IN THE HOLY SUTRAS IT IS WRITTEN THAT THOSE STRONGEST IN WRONG DOING CAN BECOME BY POWER OF GOOD RESOLVE THE STRONGEST IN RIGHT DOING I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART AND I HOPE THAT BETTER FORTUNE WILL COME TO YOU
2952-410-0020 TO NIGHT I SHALL RECITE THE SUTRAS FOR YOUR SAKE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE FORCE TO OVERCOME THE KARMA OF ANY PAST ERRORS WITH THESE ASSURANCES KWAIRYO BADE THE ARUJI GOOD NIGHT AND HIS HOST SHOWED HIM TO A VERY SMALL SIDE ROOM WHERE A BED HAD BEEN MADE READY
2952-410-0021 THEN ALL WENT TO SLEEP EXCEPT THE PRIEST WHO BEGAN TO READ THE SUTRAS BY THE LIGHT OF A PAPER LANTERN UNTIL A LATE HOUR HE CONTINUED TO READ AND PRAY
2952-410-0022 THE NIGHT WAS BEAUTIFUL THERE WAS NO CLOUD IN THE SKY THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE STRONG MOONLIGHT THREW DOWN SHARP BLACK SHADOWS OF FOLIAGE AND GLITTERED ON THE DEWS OF THE GARDEN
2952-410-0023 AND THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHBORING CASCADE DEEPENED WITH THE NIGHT KWAIRYO FELT THIRSTY AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE OF THE WATER AND REMEMBERING THE BAMBOO AQUEDUCT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GO THERE AND GET A DRINK WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
2952-410-0024 VERY GENTLY HE PUSHED APART THE SLIDING SCREENS THAT SEPARATED HIS ROOM FROM THE MAIN APARTMENT AND HE SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN FIVE RECUMBENT BODIES WITHOUT HEADS
2952-410-0025 FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0026 AND REMOVE THE BODY TO ANOTHER PLACE THE HEAD WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO JOIN ITSELF AGAIN TO THE NECK AND THE BOOK FURTHER SAYS THAT WHEN THE HEAD COMES BACK AND FINDS THAT ITS BODY HAS BEEN MOVED IT WILL STRIKE ITSELF UPON THE FLOOR THREE TIMES BOUNDING LIKE A BALL AND WILL PANT AS IN GREAT FEAR
2952-410-0027 AND PRESENTLY DIE NOW IF THESE BE ROKURO KUBI THEY MEAN ME NO GOOD SO I SHALL BE JUSTIFIED IN FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE BOOK HE SEIZED THE BODY OF THE ARUJI BY THE FEET PULLED IT TO THE WINDOW AND PUSHED IT OUT
2952-410-0028 GENTLY UNBARRING THE DOOR HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE GARDEN AND PROCEEDED WITH ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO THE GROVE BEYOND IT HE HEARD VOICES TALKING IN THE GROVE AND HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICES STEALING FROM SHADOW TO SHADOW UNTIL HE REACHED A GOOD HIDING PLACE
2952-410-0029 THEN FROM BEHIND A TRUNK HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HEADS ALL FIVE OF THEM FLITTING ABOUT AND CHATTING AS THEY FLITTED THEY WERE EATING WORMS AND INSECTS WHICH THEY FOUND ON THE GROUND OR AMONG THE TREES
2952-410-0030 PRESENTLY THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI STOPPED EATING AND SAID AH THAT TRAVELING PRIEST WHO CAME TO NIGHT HOW FAT ALL HIS BODY IS WHEN WE SHALL HAVE EATEN HIM OUR BELLIES WILL BE WELL FILLED I WAS FOOLISH TO TALK TO HIM AS I DID
2952-410-0031 TO GO NEAR HIM WHILE HE IS RECITING WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND WE CANNOT TOUCH HIM SO LONG AS HE IS PRAYING BUT AS IT IS NOW NEARLY MORNING PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP SOME ONE OF YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE WHAT THE FELLOW IS DOING
2952-410-0032 ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
2952-410-0033 HE HAS TAKEN THE BODY OF OUR ARUJI AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE HAS PUT IT AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI DISTINCTLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT ASSUMED A FRIGHTFUL ASPECT ITS EYES OPENED MONSTROUSLY ITS HAIR STOOD UP BRISTLING AND ITS TEETH GNASHED
2952-410-0034 SINCE MY BODY HAS BEEN MOVED TO REJOIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN I MUST DIE AND ALL THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT PRIEST
2952-410-0035 AND THERE HE IS BEHIND THAT TREE HIDING BEHIND THAT TREE SEE HIM THE FAT COWARD IN THE SAME MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER FOUR HEADS SPRANG AT KWAIRYO
2952-410-0036 BUT THE STRONG PRIEST HAD ALREADY ARMED HIMSELF BY PLUCKING UP A YOUNG TREE AND WITH THAT TREE HE STRUCK THE HEADS AS THEY CAME KNOCKING THEM FROM HIM WITH TREMENDOUS BLOWS FOUR OF THEM FLED AWAY BUT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI THOUGH BATTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN DESPERATELY CONTINUED TO BOUND AT THE PRIEST
2952-410-0037 AND AT LAST CAUGHT HIM BY THE LEFT SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE KWAIRYO HOWEVER AS QUICKLY GRIPPED THE HEAD BY ITS TOPKNOT AND REPEATEDLY STRUCK IT IT DID NOT RELEASE ITS HOLD BUT IT UTTERED A LONG MOAN AND THEREAFTER CEASED TO STRUGGLE IT WAS DEAD
2952-410-0038 BUT ITS TEETH STILL HELD THE SLEEVE AND FOR ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH KWAIRYO COULD NOT FORCE OPEN THE JAWS WITH THE HEAD STILL HANGING TO HIS SLEEVE HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND THERE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE OTHER FOUR ROKURO KUBI SQUATTING TOGETHER
2952-410-0039 WITH THEIR BRUISED AND BLEEDING HEADS REUNITED TO THEIR BODIES BUT WHEN THEY PERCEIVED HIM AT THE BACK DOOR ALL SCREAMED THE PRIEST THE PRIEST AND FLED THROUGH THE OTHER DOORWAY OUT INTO THE WOODS EASTWARD THE SKY WAS BRIGHTENING DAY WAS ABOUT TO DAWN
2952-410-0040 AND KWAIRYO KNEW THAT THE POWER OF THE GOBLINS WAS LIMITED TO THE HOURS OF DARKNESS HE LOOKED AT THE HEAD CLINGING TO HIS SLEEVE ITS FACE ALL FOULED WITH BLOOD AND FOAM AND CLAY AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0041 AFTER WHICH HE GATHERED TOGETHER HIS FEW BELONGINGS AND LEISURELY DESCENDED THE MOUNTAIN TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY RIGHT ON HE JOURNEYED UNTIL HE CAME TO SUWA
2952-410-0042 SEIZED THE PRIEST AND TOOK HIM TO JAIL FOR THEY SUPPOSED THE HEAD TO BE THE HEAD OF A MURDERED MAN WHO IN THE MOMENT OF BEING KILLED HAD CAUGHT THE MURDERER'S SLEEVE IN HIS TEETH AS THE KWAIRYO HE ONLY SMILED AND SAID NOTHING WHEN THEY QUESTIONED HIM
2952-410-0043 SO AFTER HAVING PASSED A NIGHT IN PRISON HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE DISTRICT THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO EXPLAIN HOW HE A PRIEST HAD BEEN FOUND WITH THE HEAD OF A MAN FASTENED TO HIS SLEEVE AND WHY HE HAD DARED THUS SHAMELESSLY TO PARADE HIS CRIME IN THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE
2952-410-0044 KWAIRYO LAUGHED LONG AND LOUDLY AT THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN HE SAID SIRS I DID NOT FASTEN THE HEAD TO MY SLEEVE IT FASTENED ITSELF THERE MUCH AGAINST MY WILL AND I HAVE NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME FOR THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS THE HEAD OF A GOBLIN
2952-410-0045 BUT THE MAGISTRATES DID NOT LAUGH THEY JUDGED HIM TO BE A HARDENED CRIMINAL AND HIS STORY AN INSULT TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEREFORE WITHOUT FURTHER QUESTIONING THEY DECIDED TO ORDER HIS IMMEDIATE EXECUTION ALL OF THEM EXCEPT ONE
2952-410-0046 A VERY OLD MAN THIS AGED OFFICER HAD MADE NO REMARK DURING THE TRIAL BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE OPINION OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE ROSE UP AND SAID LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE HEAD CAREFULLY FOR THIS I THINK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE
2952-410-0047 THE OLD MAN TURNED IT ROUND AND ROUND CAREFULLY EXAMINED IT AND DISCOVERED ON THE NAPE OF ITS NECK SEVERAL STRANGE RED CHARACTERS HE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF HIS COLLEAGUES TO THESE AND ALSO BADE THEM OBSERVE THAT THE EDGES OF THE NECK NOWHERE PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN CUT BY ANY WEAPON
2952-410-0048 ON THE CONTRARY THE LINE OF LEVERANCE WAS SMOOTH AS THE LINE AT WHICH A FALLING LEAF DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE STEM THEN SAID THE ELDER I AM QUITE SURE THAT THE PRIEST TOLD US NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THIS IS THE HEAD OF A ROKURO KUBI
2952-410-0049 THERE ARE THE CHARACTERS YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAINTED MOREOVER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SUCH GOBLINS HAVE BEEN DWELLING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE PROVINCE OF KAI FROM VERY ANCIENT TIME BUT YOU SIR HE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO KWAIRYO
2952-410-0050 PERHAPS YOU ONCE BELONGED TO THE SAMURAI CLASS
2952-410-0051 BEFORE BECOMING A PRIEST I LONG FOLLOWED THE PROFESSION OF ARMS AND IN THOSE DAYS I NEVER FEARED MAN OR DEVIL MY NAME THEN WAS ISOGAI HEIDAZAEMON TAKETSURA OF KYUSHU THERE MAY BE SOME AMONG YOU WHO REMEMBER IT
2952-410-0052 AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FILLED THE COURT ROOM FOR THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO REMEMBERED IT AND KWAIRYO IMMEDIATELY FOUND HIMSELF AMONG FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUDGES FRIENDS ANXIOUS TO PROVE THEIR ADMIRATION BY FRATERNAL KINDNESS
2952-410-0053 WHEN KWAIRYO LEFT SUWA HE WAS AS HAPPY AS ANY PRIEST IS PERMITTED TO BE IN THIS TRANSITORY WORLD AS FOR THE HEAD HE TOOK IT WITH HIM JOCOSELY INSISTING THAT HE INTENDED IT FOR A MIYAGE AND NOW IT ONLY REMAINS TO TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE HEAD
2952-410-0054 A DAY OR TWO AFTER LEAVING SUWA KWAIRYO MET WITH A ROBBER WHO STOPPED HIM IN A LONESOME PLACE AND BADE HIM STRIP KWAIRYO AT ONCE REMOVED HIS KOROMO AND OFFERED IT TO THE ROBBER WHO THEN FIRST PERCEIVED WHAT WAS HANGING TO THE SLEEVE
2952-410-0055 THOUGH BRAVE THE HIGHWAYMAN WAS STARTLED HE DROPPED THE GARMENT AND SPRANG BACK THEN HE CRIED OUT YOU
2952-410-0056 KWAIRYO ANSWERED I SHALL LET YOU HAVE THE HEAD AND THE ROBE IF YOU INSIST BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS A GOBLIN'S HEAD SO IF YOU BUY IT AND HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE NOT DECEIVED BY ME
2952-410-0057 WHAT A NICE PRIEST YOU ARE EXCLAIMED THE ROBBER YOU KILL MEN AND JEST ABOUT IT BUT I AM REALLY IN EARNEST HERE IS MY ROBE AND HERE IS THE MONEY AND LET ME HAVE THE HEAD WHAT IS THE USE OF JOKING
2952-410-0058 TAKE THE THING SAID KWAIRYO I WAS NOT JOKING
2952-410-0059 AND HE THEN BECAME AFRAID THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI MIGHT GIVE HIM TROUBLE SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE BACK THE HEAD TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD COME AND TO BURY IT WITH ITS BODY HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE LONELY COTTAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF KAI BUT NOBODY WAS THERE
2952-410-0060 AND HE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE BODY THEREFORE HE BURIED THE HEAD BY ITSELF IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE COTTAGE AND HE HAD A TOMBSTONE SET UP OVER THE GRAVE AND HE CAUSED A SEGAKI SERVICE TO BE PERFORMED ON BEHALF OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI
