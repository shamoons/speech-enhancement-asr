298-126791-0000 THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
298-126791-0001 AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
298-126791-0002 HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
298-126791-0003 AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
298-126791-0004 NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
298-126791-0005 THE TONGUE IS WELL AND THE PULSE BEGINS TO LOWER AGAIN AH THE BLEEDING DID YOU GOOD PHLEBOTOMY IS A SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC FOR SOUTHERN CONSTITUTIONS

298-126791-0007 SOFTLY MY GOOD FRIEND SOFTLY SAID THE YOUTH FALLING BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND LOSING SOME OF THAT COLOR WHICH ALARMED HIS COMPANION I BELIEVE IN EXTRACTING THE BALL YOU DID FOR ME ALL THAT IS REQUIRED I AM FREE FROM PAIN AND ONLY WEAK I DO ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON WITH HEAT
298-126791-0008 IT IS PRESUMPTUOUS IN YOU TO PRETEND TO TELL YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WHEN YOU ARE FREE FROM PAIN IF IT BE NOT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE IN SUCH MATTERS OF WHAT AVAIL THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE FOR SHAME GEORGE FOR SHAME EVEN THAT PERVERSE FELLOW JOHN LAWTON COULD NOT BEHAVE WITH MORE OBSTINACY
298-126791-0009 HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
298-126791-0010 IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
298-126791-0011 EVERYTHING IS AS YOU LEFT IT BUT IT GLIDED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE GRACE OF A FAIRY AND THE TENDERNESS OF AN ANGEL
298-126791-0012 AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
298-126791-0013 HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
298-126791-0014 THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
298-126791-0015 THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0017 AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
298-126791-0018 IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
298-126791-0019 CONSCIOUS INTEREST KEPT HER TONGUE TIED UNTIL HER SISTER WITH THE FRANKNESS OF INNOCENCE HAD PUT THE DESIRED QUESTION TO DOCTOR SITGREAVES COLONEL WELLMERE SAID THE OPERATOR GRAVELY IS IN WHAT I CALL A STATE OF FREE WILL MADAM HE IS ILL OR HE IS WELL AS HE PLEASES
298-126791-0020 HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
298-126791-0021 HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
298-126791-0022 AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
298-126791-0023 THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
298-126791-0024 FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
298-126791-0025 THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
298-126791-0026 BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
298-126791-0027 BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
298-126791-0028 A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
298-126791-0029 HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
298-126791-0030 AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
298-126791-0031 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
298-126791-0032 IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
298-126791-0033 STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
298-126791-0035 DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
298-126791-0036 FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0038 AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
298-126791-0039 THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
298-126791-0040 MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
298-126791-0041 HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
298-126791-0042 IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
298-126791-0043 WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
298-126791-0044 HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
298-126791-0045 BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
298-126791-0046 DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
298-126791-0047 ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
298-126791-0048 HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
298-126791-0049 FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
298-126791-0050 THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0052 MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
298-126791-0053 SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
298-126791-0054 OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
298-126791-0055 FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
298-126791-0056 A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
298-126791-0057 BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
298-126791-0058 THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
298-126791-0059 TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
298-126791-0060 ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
298-126791-0061 AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
298-126791-0062 WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
298-126791-0063 IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
298-126791-0064 HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
298-126791-0065 YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
298-126791-0066 THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
298-126791-0067 TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
