2989-138035-0000 IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
2989-138035-0001 AND BOTH STUDENTS AND PEASANTS WERE STRUCK WITH THE SAME AMAZEMENT THAT EVERYBODY FELT WHO SAW DON QUIXOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WERE DYING TO KNOW WHO THIS MAN SO DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY MEN COULD BE DON QUIXOTE SALUTED THEM AND AFTER ASCERTAINING THAT THEIR ROAD WAS THE SAME AS HIS
2989-138035-0002 MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
2989-138035-0003 WHICH WAS THAT OF A KNIGHT ERRANT SEEKING ADVENTURES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD HE INFORMED THEM THAT HIS OWN NAME WAS DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THAT HE WAS CALLED BY WAY OF SURNAME THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS ALL THIS WAS GREEK OR GIBBERISH TO THE PEASANTS
2989-138035-0004 FOR ALL THAT HOWEVER THEY REGARDED HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT AND ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIM IF YOU SIR KNIGHT HAVE NO FIXED ROAD AS IT IS THE WAY WITH THOSE WHO SEEK ADVENTURES NOT TO HAVE ANY LET YOUR WORSHIP COME WITH US
2989-138035-0005 WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
2989-138035-0006 AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS CALLED CAMACHO THE RICH SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND HE TWENTY TWO AND THEY ARE FAIRLY MATCHED THOUGH SOME KNOWING ONES WHO HAVE ALL THE PEDIGREES IN THE WORLD BY HEART WILL HAVE IT THAT THE FAMILY OF THE FAIR QUITERIA IS BETTER THAN CAMACHO'S
2989-138035-0007 BUT NO ONE MINDS THAT NOW A DAYS FOR WEALTH CAN SOLDER A GREAT MANY FLAWS AT ANY RATE CAMACHO IS FREE HANDED
2989-138035-0008 HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
2989-138035-0009 NOR OF THE MANY OTHERS I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION
2989-138035-0010 AND HE LIVED IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO THAT OF HER PARENTS
2989-138035-0011 SO THAT THE LOVES OF THE TWO CHILDREN BASILIO AND QUITERIA
2989-138035-0012 HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
2989-138035-0013 WHO HAD NOT SO LARGE A SHARE OF THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE AS OF NATURE FOR IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD UNGRUDGINGLY HE IS THE MOST AGILE YOUTH WE KNOW A MIGHTY THROWER OF THE BAR A FIRST RATE WRESTLER AND A GREAT BALL PLAYER HE RUNS LIKE A DEER AND LEAPS BETTER THAN A GOAT
2989-138035-0014 BOWLS OVER THE NINE PINS AS IF BY MAGIC
2989-138035-0015 AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
2989-138035-0016 SAY THAT TO MY WIFE SAID SANCHO WHO HAD UNTIL NOW LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR SHE WON'T HEAR OF ANYTHING BUT EACH ONE MARRYING HIS EQUAL HOLDING WITH THE PROVERB EACH EWE TO HER LIKE
2989-138035-0017 IF ALL THOSE WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY SAID DON QUIXOTE IT WOULD DEPRIVE PARENTS OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MARRY THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PROPER PERSON AND AT THE PROPER TIME AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO DAUGHTERS TO CHOOSE HUSBANDS AS THEY PLEASED
2989-138035-0018 ONE WOULD BE FOR CHOOSING HER FATHER'S SERVANT AND ANOTHER SOME ONE SHE HAS SEEN PASSING IN THE STREET AND FANCIES GALLANT AND DASHING THOUGH HE MAY BE A DRUNKEN BULLY
2989-138035-0019 AND THE MATRIMONIAL CHOICE IS VERY LIABLE TO ERROR
2989-138035-0020 WHY THEN SHOULD NOT HE DO THE SAME WHO HAS TO MAKE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF LIFE DOWN TO THE FINAL HALTING PLACE OF DEATH MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANION HAS TO BE HIS COMPANION IN BED AT BOARD AND EVERYWHERE AS THE WIFE IS TO HER HUSBAND
2989-138035-0021 HE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN TO SMILE OR HEARD TO UTTER RATIONAL WORD AND HE ALWAYS GOES ABOUT MOODY AND DEJECTED TALKING TO HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT SHOWS PLAINLY HE IS OUT OF HIS SENSES HE EATS LITTLE AND SLEEPS LITTLE AND ALL HE EATS IS FRUIT AND WHEN HE SLEEPS
2989-138035-0022 IF HE SLEEPS AT ALL IT IS IN THE FIELD ON THE HARD EARTH LIKE A BRUTE BEAST SOMETIMES HE GAZES AT THE SKY
2989-138035-0023 THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A CLOTHED STATUE WITH ITS DRAPERY STIRRED BY THE WIND IN SHORT HE SHOWS SUCH SIGNS OF A HEART CRUSHED BY SUFFERING THAT ALL WE WHO KNOW HIM
2989-138035-0024 AND ANY ONE OF THEM OR ANY MOMENT THE HOUSE MAY FALL I HAVE SEEN THE RAIN COMING DOWN AND THE SUN SHINING ALL AT ONE TIME
2989-138035-0025 AND TELL ME IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN BOAST OF HAVING DRIVEN A NAIL INTO THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE NO FAITH AND BETWEEN A WOMAN'S YES AND NO I WOULDN'T VENTURE TO PUT THE POINT OF A PIN

2989-138035-0029 BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO
2989-138035-0030 MAYBE THERE ARE TOLEDANS WHO DO NOT HIT IT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO POLISHED TALK THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LICENTIATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BRED UP IN THE TANNERIES
2989-138035-0031 AND YET THEY ARE ALL TOLEDANS PURE CORRECT
2989-138035-0032 THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
2989-138035-0033 WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
2989-138035-0034 AND THESE JOINED WITH MY RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SMALL WILL MAKE YOU CONFESS THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN DISMOUNT AND PUT IN PRACTICE YOUR POSITIONS AND CIRCLES AND ANGLES AND SCIENCE FOR I HOPE TO MAKE YOU SEE STARS AT NOONDAY WITH MY RUDE RAW SWORDSMANSHIP
2989-138035-0035 WHO WILL MAKE ME TURN MY BACK AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE WORLD I WILL NOT COMPEL TO GIVE GROUND AS TO WHETHER YOU TURN YOUR BACK OR NOT I DO NOT CONCERN MYSELF REPLIED THE MASTER OF FENCE
2989-138035-0036 THOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR GRAVE WOULD BE DUG ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU PLANTED YOUR FOOT THE FIRST TIME I MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD THERE FOR DESPISING SKILL WITH THE SWORD
2989-138035-0037 BUT HE WAS MET BY A TAP ON THE MOUTH FROM THE BUTTON OF THE LICENTIATE'S SWORD THAT CHECKED HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS FURIOUS ONSET AND MADE HIM KISS IT AS IF IT WERE A RELIC THOUGH NOT AS DEVOUTLY AS RELICS ARE AND OUGHT TO BE KISSED
2989-138035-0038 THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE LICENTIATE RECKONED UP FOR HIM BY THRUSTS EVERY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF THE SHORT CASSOCK HE WORE TORE THE SKIRTS INTO STRIPS LIKE THE TAILS OF A CUTTLEFISH KNOCKED OFF HIS HAT TWICE AND SO COMPLETELY TIRED HIM OUT
2989-138035-0039 THAT IN VEXATION ANGER AND RAGE HE TOOK THE SWORD BY THE HILT AND FLUNG IT AWAY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ONE OF THE PEASANTS THAT WERE THERE WHO WAS A NOTARY AND WHO WENT FOR IT MADE AN AFFIDAVIT AFTERWARDS THAT HE SENT IT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE
2989-138035-0040 BY MY FAITH SENOR BACHELOR IF YOUR WORSHIP TAKES MY ADVICE YOU WILL NEVER CHALLENGE ANYONE TO FENCE AGAIN ONLY TO WRESTLE AND THROW THE BAR FOR YOU HAVE THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THESE FENCERS AS THEY CALL THEM I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0041 THEY CAN PUT THE POINT OF A SWORD THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH HAVING TUMBLED OFF MY DONKEY SAID CORCHUELO AND WITH HAVING HAD THE TRUTH I WAS SO IGNORANT OF PROVED TO ME BY EXPERIENCE AND GETTING UP HE EMBRACED THE LICENTIATE
2989-138035-0042 AND THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN EVER AND NOT CARING TO WAIT FOR THE NOTARY WHO HAD GONE FOR THE SWORD
2989-138035-0043 THEY RESOLVED TO PUSH ON SO AS TO REACH THE VILLAGE OF QUITERIA TO WHICH THEY ALL BELONGED IN GOOD TIME DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY THE LICENTIATE HELD FORTH TO THEM ON THE EXCELLENCES OF THE SWORD WITH SUCH CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENTS AND SUCH FIGURES AND MATHEMATICAL PROOFS
2989-138035-0044 IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
2989-138035-0045 PSALTERIES PIPES
2989-138035-0046 WERE FILLED WITH LIGHTS UNAFFECTED BY THE WIND FOR THE BREEZE AT THE TIME WAS SO GENTLE THAT IT HAD NOT POWER TO STIR THE LEAVES ON THE TREES THE MUSICIANS WERE THE LIFE OF THE WEDDING WANDERING THROUGH THE PLEASANT GROUNDS IN SEPARATE BANDS SOME DANCING
2989-138035-0047 OTHERS SINGING OTHERS PLAYING THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALREADY MENTIONED
2989-138035-0048 WERE FRISKING AND GAMBOLLING ALL OVER THE MEADOW
2989-138035-0049 EVEN WERE IT UNDER GILDED CEILINGS AND SO TURNED ASIDE A LITTLE OUT OF THE ROAD
2989-138035-0050 AS THE GOOD QUARTERS HE HAD ENJOYED IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF DON DIEGO CAME BACK TO HIS MIND
2989-138035-0051 WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR
2989-138035-0052 SCARCE HAD THE FAIR AURORA GIVEN BRIGHT PHOEBUS TIME TO DRY THE LIQUID PEARLS UPON HER GOLDEN LOCKS WITH THE HEAT OF HIS FERVENT RAYS WHEN DON QUIXOTE SHAKING OFF SLOTH FROM HIS LIMBS
2989-138035-0053 SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING
2989-138035-0054 THAT WITHOUT ENVYING OR BEING ENVIED SLEEPEST
2989-138035-0055 TO INTERFERE WITH THY REPOSE AMBITION BREAKS NOT THY REST NOR DOTH THIS WORLD'S EMPTY POMP DISTURB THEE FOR THE UTMOST REACH OF THY ANXIETY IS TO PROVIDE FOR THY ASS
2989-138035-0056 SINCE UPON MY SHOULDERS THOU HAST LAID THE SUPPORT OF THYSELF THE COUNTERPOISE AND BURDEN THAT NATURE AND CUSTOM HAVE IMPOSED UPON MASTERS THE SERVANT SLEEPS AND THE MASTER LIES AWAKE THINKING HOW HE IS TO FEED HIM ADVANCE HIM AND REWARD HIM
2989-138035-0057 HE AWOKE AT LAST DROWSY AND LAZY AND CASTING HIS EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION OBSERVED THERE COMES IF I DON'T MISTAKE
2989-138035-0058 A WEDDING THAT BEGINS WITH SMELLS LIKE THAT BY MY FAITH OUGHT TO BE PLENTIFUL AND UNSTINTING HAVE DONE THOU GLUTTON SAID DON QUIXOTE COME LET US GO AND WITNESS THIS BRIDAL AND SEE WHAT THE REJECTED BASILIO DOES
2989-138035-0059 LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES RETURNED SANCHO BE HE NOT POOR HE WOULD MARRY QUITERIA TO MAKE A GRAND MATCH FOR HIMSELF AND HE WITHOUT A FARTHING IS THERE NOTHING ELSE FAITH
2989-138035-0060 SENOR IT'S MY OPINION THE POOR MAN SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH WHAT HE CAN GET
2989-138035-0061 AND IF THAT BE SO AS NO DOUBT IT IS
2989-138035-0062 BUT WHEN SUCH GIFTS FALL TO ONE THAT HAS HARD CASH I WISH MY CONDITION OF LIFE WAS AS BECOMING AS THEY ARE
2989-138035-0063 FOR GOD'S SAKE SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE HERE
2989-138035-0064 ONE OF THEM WAS THAT I WAS TO BE LET SAY ALL I LIKED SO LONG AS IT WAS NOT AGAINST MY NEIGHBOUR OR YOUR WORSHIP'S AUTHORITY AND SO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME I HAVE NOT BROKEN THE SAID ARTICLE
2989-138035-0065 AND EVEN IF IT WERE SO I DESIRE YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND COME ALONG FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO ENLIVEN THE VALLEYS AGAIN AND NO DOUBT THE MARRIAGE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON
2989-138035-0066 AND SIX STEWPOTS THAT STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN THE ORDINARY MOULD OF COMMON POTS FOR THEY WERE SIX HALF WINE JARS EACH FIT TO HOLD THE CONTENTS OF A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
2989-138035-0067 THEY SWALLOWED UP WHOLE SHEEP AND HID THEM AWAY IN THEIR INSIDES WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MORE SIGN OF THEM THAN IF THEY WERE PIGEONS
2989-138035-0068 OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
2989-138035-0069 THERE WAS A WALL MADE OF CHEESES ARRANGED LIKE OPEN BRICK WORK AND TWO CAULDRONS FULL OF OIL
2989-138035-0070 AND PLUNGED INTO ANOTHER CAULDRON OF PREPARED HONEY THAT STOOD CLOSE BY OF COOKS AND COOK MAIDS THERE WERE OVER FIFTY ALL CLEAN BRISK AND BLITHE IN THE CAPACIOUS BELLY OF THE OX WERE A DOZEN SOFT LITTLE SUCKING PIGS WHICH SEWN UP THERE
2989-138035-0071 THE SPICES OF DIFFERENT KINDS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY THE POUND BUT BY THE QUARTER AND ALL LAY OPEN TO VIEW IN A GREAT CHEST
2989-138035-0072 BUT ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO FEED AN ARMY
2989-138035-0073 CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS
2989-138035-0074 GET DOWN AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A LADLE AND SKIM OFF A HEN OR TWO AND MUCH GOOD MAY THEY DO YOU I DON'T SEE ONE SAID SANCHO WAIT A BIT SAID THE COOK SINNER THAT I AM HOW PARTICULAR AND BASHFUL YOU ARE
2989-138035-0075 AND SO SAYING HE SEIZED A BUCKET AND PLUNGING IT INTO ONE OF THE HALF JARS TOOK UP THREE HENS AND A COUPLE OF GEESE
2989-138035-0076 FALL TO FRIEND AND TAKE THE EDGE OFF YOUR APPETITE WITH THESE SKIMMINGS UNTIL DINNER TIME COMES
2989-138035-0077 WELL THEN SAID THE COOK TAKE SPOON AND ALL FOR CAMACHO'S WEALTH AND HAPPINESS FURNISH EVERYTHING
2989-138035-0078 DON QUIXOTE WAS WATCHING THE ENTRANCE AT ONE END OF THE ARCADE OF SOME TWELVE PEASANTS ALL IN HOLIDAY AND GALA DRESS
