302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
