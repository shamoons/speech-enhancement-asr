307-127539-0030 AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
307-127539-0031 WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
