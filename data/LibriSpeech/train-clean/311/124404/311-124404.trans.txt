311-124404-0000 I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
311-124404-0001 I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
311-124404-0002 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0003 AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
311-124404-0004 TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
311-124404-0005 AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
311-124404-0006 BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
311-124404-0007 FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
311-124404-0008 TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
311-124404-0009 ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
311-124404-0010 FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
311-124404-0011 I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
311-124404-0012 MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
311-124404-0013 AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
311-124404-0014 AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
311-124404-0015 FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
311-124404-0016 I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
311-124404-0017 THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
311-124404-0018 AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
311-124404-0019 I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
311-124404-0020 AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
311-124404-0021 AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0022 I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
311-124404-0023 TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
311-124404-0024 AND THE METALS PRODUCED IN THE MINES AND THE PLANTS GROW IN THE FIELDS AND IN GENERAL HOW ALL THE BODIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED MIXED OR COMPOSITE MIGHT BE GENERATED AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE DISCOVERIES ALLUDED TO
311-124404-0025 I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
311-124404-0026 TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
311-124404-0027 AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
311-124404-0028 FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
311-124404-0029 TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0030 BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
311-124404-0031 SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
311-124404-0032 IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
311-124404-0033 FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
311-124404-0034 BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
311-124404-0035 NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
311-124404-0036 OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
311-124404-0037 AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
311-124404-0038 AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
311-124404-0039 CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
311-124404-0040 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0041 WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
311-124404-0042 TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF GETTING DISSECTED IN THEIR PRESENCE THE HEART OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL POSSESSED OF LUNGS
311-124404-0043 AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
311-124404-0044 WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
311-124404-0045 PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
311-124404-0046 TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
311-124404-0047 WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
311-124404-0048 I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
311-124404-0049 THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
311-124404-0050 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0051 TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0052 BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
311-124404-0053 WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
311-124404-0054 AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
311-124404-0055 AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
311-124404-0056 FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
311-124404-0057 INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
311-124404-0058 BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
311-124404-0059 ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
311-124404-0060 OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
311-124404-0061 CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
311-124404-0062 AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
311-124404-0063 VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
311-124404-0064 WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
311-124404-0065 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0066 TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
311-124404-0067 FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
311-124404-0068 THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
311-124404-0069 AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
311-124404-0070 SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
311-124404-0071 CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
311-124404-0072 THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
311-124404-0073 FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
311-124404-0074 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0075 WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
311-124404-0076 SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
311-124404-0077 IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
311-124404-0078 AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0081 SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
311-124404-0082 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0083 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
311-124404-0084 AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
311-124404-0085 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0087 AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
311-124404-0088 WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
311-124404-0089 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0090 ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
311-124404-0091 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0093 WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
311-124404-0094 I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
311-124404-0095 TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
311-124404-0096 WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
311-124404-0097 THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
311-124404-0098 BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
311-124404-0099 TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
311-124404-0100 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0101 AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
311-124404-0102 WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
311-124404-0103 OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
311-124404-0104 FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
311-124404-0105 APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
311-124404-0106 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0108 DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0109 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
311-124404-0111 SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
311-124404-0112 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0114 THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
311-124404-0115 AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
311-124404-0116 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0117 AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
311-124404-0118 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
311-124404-0119 THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
311-124404-0120 AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
