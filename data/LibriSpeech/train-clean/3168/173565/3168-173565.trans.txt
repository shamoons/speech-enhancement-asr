3168-173565-0000 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0001 WERE IN THE DOCTOR'S OPINION SURE TO CARRY HIM OFF BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE ATE WITH PLEASURE A PIECE OF BREAD WITH SOME TEA AND THE DOCTOR NOTICED THAT HIS TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER HE HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MORNING THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER THEY LEFT MOSCOW
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0004 HE FELT PRINCE ANDREW'S PULSE AND TO HIS SURPRISE AND DISSATISFACTION FOUND IT HAD IMPROVED HE WAS DISSATISFIED BECAUSE HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HIS PATIENT DID NOT DIE NOW HE WOULD DO SO A LITTLE LATER WITH GREATER SUFFERING
3168-173565-0005 TIMOKHIN THE RED NOSED MAJOR OF PRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT HAD JOINED HIM IN MOSCOW AND WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG WITH HIM HAVING BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LEG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0007 I DON'T WANT ANY MORE IS TIMOKHIN HERE HE ASKED TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM I AM HERE YOUR EXCELLENCY HOW'S YOUR WOUND MINE SIR
3168-173565-0008 PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN PONDERED AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING COULDN'T ONE GET A BOOK HE ASKED WHAT BOOK THE GOSPELS I HAVEN'T ONE
3168-173565-0009 THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO PROCURE IT FOR HIM AND BEGAN TO ASK HOW HE WAS FEELING PRINCE ANDREW ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS RELUCTANTLY BUT REASONABLY
3168-173565-0010 AND THEN SAID HE WANTED A BOLSTER PLACED UNDER HIM AS HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN GREAT PAIN THE DOCTOR AND VALET LIFTED THE CLOAK WITH WHICH HE WAS COVERED AND MAKING WRY FACES AT THE NOISOME SMELL OF MORTIFYING FLESH
3168-173565-0011 THAT CAME FROM THE WOUND BEGAN EXAMINING THAT DREADFUL PLACE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED ABOUT SOMETHING AND MADE A CHANGE IN THE DRESSINGS TURNING THE WOUNDED MAN OVER SO THAT HE GROANED AGAIN AND GREW UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS FROM THE AGONY
3168-173565-0012 HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
3168-173565-0013 HE PLEADED IN A PITEOUS VOICE THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE PASSAGE TO WASH HIS HANDS YOU FELLOWS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE SAID HE TO THE VALET WHO WAS POURING WATER OVER HIS HANDS
3168-173565-0014 THAT I WONDER HOW HE CAN BEAR IT BY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT SOMETHING UNDER HIM SAID THE VALET THE FIRST TIME PRINCE ANDREW UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND REMEMBERED BEING WOUNDED AND HOW
3168-173565-0015 WAS WHEN HE ASKED TO BE CARRIED INTO THE HUT AFTER HIS CALECHE HAD STOPPED AT MYTISHCHI AFTER GROWING CONFUSED FROM PAIN WHILE BEING CARRIED INTO THE HUT HE AGAIN REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHILE DRINKING TEA ONCE MORE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
3168-173565-0016 AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
3168-173565-0017 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0019 SOMEONE WAS SHOUTING AND SINGING IN THE STREET COCKROACHES RUSTLED ON THE TABLE ON THE ICONS AND ON THE WALLS AND A BIG FLY FLOPPED AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND AROUND THE CANDLE BESIDE HIM THE WICK OF WHICH WAS CHARRED AND HAD SHAPED ITSELF LIKE A MUSHROOM
3168-173565-0020 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0022 ALL THE POWERS OF HIS MIND WERE MORE ACTIVE AND CLEARER THAN EVER BUT THEY ACTED APART FROM HIS WILL MOST DIVERSE THOUGHTS AND IMAGES OCCUPIED HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT TIMES HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WORK WITH A VIGOR CLEARNESS AND DEPTH
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0024 HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
3168-173565-0025 EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
3168-173565-0026 AND PRINCE ANDREW HEARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS A DELUSION OR REALITY A SOFT WHISPERING VOICE INCESSANTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY REPEATING PITI PITI PITI AND THEN
3168-173565-0027 AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
3168-173565-0028 TO THE SOUND OF THIS WHISPERED MUSIC HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO BALANCE CAREFULLY THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THAT THIS AIRY STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT KEPT COLLAPSING AND AGAIN SLOWLY RISING TO THE SOUND OF
3168-173565-0029 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0031 EACH TIME THE FLY TOUCHED HIS FACE IT GAVE HIM A BURNING SENSATION AND YET TO HIS SURPRISE IT DID NOT DESTROY THE STRUCTURE THOUGH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE VERY REGION OF HIS FACE WHERE IT WAS RISING
3168-173565-0032 WHICH ALSO OPPRESSED HIM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S MY SHIRT ON THE TABLE HE THOUGHT AND THAT'S MY LEGS AND THAT IS THE DOOR BUT WHY IS IT ALWAYS STRETCHING AND DRAWING ITSELF OUT AND
3168-173565-0033 PITI PITI PITI AND TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI THAT'S ENOUGH PLEASE LEAVE OFF PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED SOMEONE AND SUDDENLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AGAIN SWAM TO THE SURFACE OF HIS MIND WITH PECULIAR CLEARNESS AND FORCE
3168-173565-0034 FOR SOME PURPOSE OR FOR SOME REASON BUT THE LOVE WHICH I WHILE DYING FIRST EXPERIENCED WHEN I SAW MY ENEMY AND YET LOVED HIM I EXPERIENCED THAT FEELING OF LOVE WHICH IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OBJECT
3168-173565-0035 NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
3168-173565-0036 BUT AN ENEMY CAN ONLY BE LOVED BY DIVINE LOVE
3168-173565-0037 IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
3168-173565-0038 YET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I HATED IN MY LIFE AND OF THEM ALL I LOVED AND HATED NONE AS I DID HER
3168-173565-0039 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0040 IF ONLY IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE HER ONCE MORE JUST ONCE LOOKING INTO THOSE EYES TO SAY PITI PITI PITI AND
3168-173565-0041 TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
3168-173565-0042 AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
3168-173565-0043 BUT BESIDES ALL THIS SOMETHING CREAKED THERE WAS A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR AND A NEW WHITE SPHINX APPEARED STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THAT SPHINX HAD THE PALE FACE AND SHINING EYES OF THE VERY NATASHA OF WHOM HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0045 BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0046 HE MOVED A LITTLE AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RINGING IN HIS EARS
3168-173565-0047 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0048 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE REAL LIVING NATASHA AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY NATASHA MOTIONLESS ON HER KNEES SHE WAS UNABLE TO STIR
3168-173565-0049 WITH FRIGHTENED EYES RIVETED ON HIM WAS RESTRAINING HER SOBS HER FACE WAS PALE AND RIGID ONLY IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SOMETHING QUIVERED PRINCE ANDREW SIGHED WITH RELIEF SMILED
3168-173565-0050 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0052 FORGIVE WHAT HE ASKED
3168-173565-0053 BROKEN WHISPER AND BEGAN KISSING HIS HAND MORE RAPIDLY JUST TOUCHING IT WITH HER LIPS I LOVE YOU MORE BETTER THAN BEFORE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LIFTING HER FACE WITH HIS HAND
3168-173565-0054 SO AS TO LOOK INTO HER EYES THOSE EYES FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY COMPASSIONATELY AND WITH JOYOUS LOVE NATASHA'S THIN PALE FACE WITH ITS SWOLLEN LIPS
3168-173565-0055 WAS MORE THAN PLAIN IT WAS DREADFUL BUT PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE THAT HE SAW HER SHINING EYES WHICH WERE BEAUTIFUL THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES BEHIND THEM PETER THE VALET WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE HAD ROUSED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0056 TIMOKHIN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG HAD LONG BEEN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON CAREFULLY COVERING HIS BARE BODY WITH THE SHEET AS HE HUDDLED UP ON HIS BENCH WHAT'S THIS SAID THE DOCTOR RISING FROM HIS BED
3168-173565-0057 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0058 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
3168-173565-0059 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3168-173565-0061 NO ONE LEAST OF ALL NATASHA AND PRINCE ANDREW SPOKE OF THIS THE UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH WHICH HUNG NOT ONLY OVER BOLKONSKI BUT OVER ALL RUSSIA
