32-21625-0000 WAS NOT THE ONLY VILLAGE TO BE SEEN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN THERE WAS ANOTHER WHICH FARMER GREEN SELDOM VISITED BECAUSE IT LAY BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN AND WAS A LONG DISTANCE FROM HIS HOUSE THOUGH HE OWNED THE LAND WHERE IT STOOD
32-21625-0001 THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0002 FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21625-0003 EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
32-21625-0004 SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
32-21625-0005 AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0006 THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
32-21625-0007 SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0008 DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
32-21625-0009 OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
32-21625-0010 WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0011 AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0012 IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
32-21625-0013 YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014 AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0015 IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
32-21625-0016 AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21625-0017 THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
