32-4137-0000 CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
32-4137-0001 THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
32-4137-0002 AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
32-4137-0003 SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
32-4137-0004 KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
32-4137-0005 WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
32-4137-0006 BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0008 AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
32-4137-0009 THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
32-4137-0010 AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
32-4137-0011 DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
32-4137-0012 HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
32-4137-0013 THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
32-4137-0014 WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU

32-4137-0022 AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
32-4137-0023 AND EVERYTHING INDICATED THAT A STEAMBOAT RACE WAS AT HAND NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EXCITEMENT ATTENDANT UPON A STEAMBOAT RACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAD REACHED MEMPHIS THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
32-4137-0024 AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025 ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0026 THE TWO BOATS SOON LOCKED SO THAT THE HANDS OF THE BOATS WERE PASSING FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL AND THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT PREVAILED THROUGHOUT AMONGST BOTH PASSENGERS AND CREW
32-4137-0027 AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028 THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0029 AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
32-4137-0030 BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT

32-4137-0040 THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
32-4137-0041 WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
32-4137-0042 WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0043 HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
32-4137-0044 TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
32-4137-0045 TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN

32-4137-0048 I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
32-4137-0049 AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
32-4137-0050 ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOAT AT BATON ROUGE AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND AMONGST THEM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE RACES GAMBLING AND DRINKING WERE NOW THE ORDER OF THE DAY
32-4137-0051 WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
32-4137-0052 AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
32-4137-0053 ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
