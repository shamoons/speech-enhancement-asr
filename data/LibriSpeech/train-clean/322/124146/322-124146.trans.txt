322-124146-0000 MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
322-124146-0001 THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
322-124146-0002 MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
322-124146-0003 SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
322-124146-0004 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
322-124146-0005 SHE ADDED THAT LIZZY SHALL BE BROUGHT TO REASON
322-124146-0006 SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0007 BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
322-124146-0008 IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
322-124146-0009 SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
322-124146-0010 HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
322-124146-0011 I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
322-124146-0012 YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
322-124146-0013 FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
322-124146-0014 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0015 OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
322-124146-0016 SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
322-124146-0017 AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
322-124146-0018 MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
322-124146-0019 WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
322-124146-0020 I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
322-124146-0021 WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
322-124146-0022 SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
322-124146-0023 I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
322-124146-0024 WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
322-124146-0025 BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
322-124146-0026 WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0027 AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
322-124146-0028 ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
322-124146-0029 DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
322-124146-0030 MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
322-124146-0031 IN A VOICE THAT MARKED HIS DISPLEASURE TO RESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR DAUGHTER RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS IS THE DUTY OF US ALL THE PECULIAR DUTY OF A YOUNG MAN
322-124146-0032 WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
322-124146-0033 HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
322-124146-0034 WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
322-124146-0035 MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
322-124146-0036 I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
322-124146-0037 AND IF MY MANNER HAS BEEN AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE
