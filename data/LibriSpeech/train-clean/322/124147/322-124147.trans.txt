322-124147-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
322-124147-0001 AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
322-124147-0002 BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0003 MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
322-124147-0004 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0005 AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
322-124147-0006 TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
322-124147-0007 THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
322-124147-0008 AND IT WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE AS AN OCCASION OF INTRODUCING HIM TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER SOON AFTER THEIR RETURN A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MISS BENNET
322-124147-0009 THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
322-124147-0010 AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
322-124147-0011 BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
322-124147-0012 IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
322-124147-0013 TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
322-124147-0014 CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
322-124147-0015 HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
322-124147-0016 AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
322-124147-0017 WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
322-124147-0018 I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
322-124147-0019 AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
322-124147-0020 IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
322-124147-0021 HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
322-124147-0022 WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
322-124147-0023 IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
322-124147-0024 SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
322-124147-0025 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0026 FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
322-124147-0027 SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
322-124147-0028 NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
322-124147-0029 BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
322-124147-0030 IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
322-124147-0031 THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
322-124147-0032 CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
322-124147-0033 IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
322-124147-0034 EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
322-124147-0035 AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
322-124147-0036 THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
322-124147-0037 HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
322-124147-0038 AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
322-124147-0039 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0040 AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
322-124147-0041 AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
322-124147-0042 THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
322-124147-0043 IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
322-124147-0044 AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
322-124147-0045 BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
322-124147-0046 BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
322-124147-0047 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
322-124147-0048 FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
322-124147-0049 MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
322-124147-0050 IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
322-124147-0051 THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0052 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0053 AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
322-124147-0054 AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
322-124147-0055 THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
322-124147-0056 AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
322-124147-0057 HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
322-124147-0058 BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
322-124147-0059 AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
322-124147-0060 WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
322-124147-0061 WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
322-124147-0062 SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
322-124147-0063 FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
322-124147-0064 FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
322-124147-0065 AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
322-124147-0066 MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
322-124147-0067 AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
322-124147-0068 IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
322-124147-0069 YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
322-124147-0070 STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
322-124147-0071 AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
322-124147-0072 NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
322-124147-0073 THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
322-124147-0074 RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
322-124147-0075 SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
322-124147-0076 AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
322-124147-0077 THE STEADY COUNTENANCE WHICH MISS LUCAS HAD COMMANDED IN TELLING HER STORY GAVE WAY TO A MOMENTARY CONFUSION HERE ON RECEIVING SO DIRECT A REPROACH THOUGH AS IT WAS NO MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED
322-124147-0078 SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
322-124147-0079 AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
322-124147-0080 I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
322-124147-0081 I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
322-124147-0082 THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
322-124147-0083 THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
