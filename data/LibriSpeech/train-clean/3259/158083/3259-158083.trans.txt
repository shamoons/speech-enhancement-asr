3259-158083-0000 ADMINISTRATION TERRORISM THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED IN ANOTHER WAY TO STOP PICKETING
3259-158083-0001 THE AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY WEAKEN SO THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE HOWEVER IN THE FACE OF THAT RECKLESS AND EXTREME SENTENCE THE LONGEST PICKET LINE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TENTH
3259-158083-0002 FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
3259-158083-0003 TO REDUCE THE NUMBER TO A MANAGEABLE SIZE BEFORE IMPRISONING THIS GROUP FAILING OF THAT THEY TRIED STILL ANOTHER WAY OUT THEY RESORTED TO IMPRISONMENT WITH TERRORISM
3259-158083-0004 IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW WIDELY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION THIS GROUP OF PICKETS WAS I GIVE ITS PERSONNEL COMPLETE FIRST GROUP NEW YORK MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN MISS BELLE SHEINBERG

3259-158083-0014 AS SHE SAID IN COURT WE TOOK THIS ACTION WITH GREAT CONSECRATION OF SPIRIT WITH WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL LIBERTY
3259-158083-0015 JUDGE MULLOWNY ADDRESSED THE PRISONERS WITH MANY HIGH SOUNDING WORDS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND INADVERTENTLY SLIPPED INTO A DISCOURSE ON RUSSIA AND THE DANGERS OF REVOLUTION
3259-158083-0016 BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
3259-158083-0017 BUT WILL TAKE THE MATTER OF SENTENCE UNDER ADVISEMENT AND SO THE GUILTY PICKETS WERE SUMMARILY RELEASED THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT RELISH THE INCARCERATION OF FORTY ONE WOMEN FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN LIMITED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS
3259-158083-0018 FORTY ONE WOMEN REPRESENTING SIXTEEN STATES IN THE UNION MIGHT CREATE A CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DISLOCATION BUT THESE SAME FORTY ONE WOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ITS CHOICE IT COULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PEACEFUL AGITATION
3259-158083-0019 OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM
3259-158083-0020 COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
3259-158083-0021 IT HAD TO STOP PICKETING WHETHER THIS WAS DONE LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY CLUMSILY OR DEXTEROUSLY WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE PICKETING MUST BE STOPPED
3259-158083-0022 USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
3259-158083-0023 BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3259-158083-0024 MISS BURNS RECEIVED SIX MONTHS IN PRONOUNCING THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE UPON MISSUS NOLAN THE JUDGE SAID THAT HE DID SO ON ACCOUNT OF HER AGE HE URGED HER HOWEVER TO PAY HER FINE HINTING THAT JAIL MIGHT BE TOO SEVERE ON HER AND MIGHT BRING ON DEATH
3259-158083-0025 AT THIS SUGGESTION TINY MISSUS NOLAN PULLED HERSELF UP ON HER TOES AND SAID WITH GREAT DIGNITY
3259-158083-0026 I HAVE A NEPHEW FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY IN FRANCE
3259-158083-0027 I SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF I DID NOT JOIN THESE BRAVE WOMEN IN THEIR FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA I SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE HONOR TO DIE IN PRISON
3259-158083-0028 FOR THE LIBERTY OF AMERICAN WOMEN
3259-158083-0029 OR DO PRISON LABOR ANY WORDS OF MINE WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO TELL THE STORY OF THE PRISONERS RECEPTION AT THE OCCOQUAN WORKHOUSE THE FOLLOWING IS THE STATEMENT OF MISSUS NOLAN DICTATED UPON HER RELEASE IN THE PRESENCE OF MISTER DUDLEY FIELD MALONE
3259-158083-0030 MISSUS HERNDON WAS STANDING BEHIND A DESK WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS OFFICE AND THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX MEN ALSO IN THE ROOM
3259-158083-0031 SAID SHE MUST SPEAK TO WHITTAKER THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PLACE
3259-158083-0032 MISSUS HERNDON CALLED MY NAME BUT I DID NOT ANSWER
3259-158083-0033 AS THEY RAN ME PAST SHE WAS LYING THERE WITH HER ARMS OUT AND WE HEARD ONE OF THE MEN YELL THE SUFFRAGER MY MOTHER AIN'T NO SUFFRAGER I'LL PUT YOU THROUGH AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
3259-158083-0034 THEY PUSHED ME THROUGH A DOOR THEN I LOST MY BALANCE AND FELL AGAINST THE IRON BED MISSUS COSU STRUCK THE WALL THEN THEY THREW IN TWO MATS AND TWO DIRTY BLANKETS
3259-158083-0035 THE DOOR WAS BARRED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
3259-158083-0036 MISSUS COSU WOULD NOT LET ME LIE ON THE FLOOR SHE PUT ME ON THE COUCH AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE TWO PADS THEY THREW IN
3259-158083-0037 WHEN MISSUS LEWIS DOUBLED OVER AND HANDLED LIKE A SACK OF SOMETHING
3259-158083-0038 AND ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS UNTIL MORNING
3259-158083-0039 I BADE THEM BOTH GOOD BY
3259-158083-0040 THEY TOOK ME TO MISTER WHITTAKER'S OFFICE

3259-158083-0043 I THINK I MADE HIM THINK HE MOTIONED TO THE GUARD GET A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE HER HE SAID IN THE HOSPITAL COTTAGE
3259-158083-0044 A NEGRO TRUSTY WAS THERE I FELL BACK AGAIN INTO THE SAME STUPOR THE NEXT DAY THEY BROUGHT ME SOME TOAST AND A PLATE OF FOOD THE FIRST I HAD BEEN OFFERED IN OVER THIRTY SIX HOURS
3259-158083-0045 I JUST LOOKED AT THE FOOD AND MOTIONED IT AWAY IT MADE ME SICK I WAS RELEASED ON THE SIXTH DAY AND PASSED THE DISPENSARY AS I CAME OUT
3259-158083-0046 AND MANY OTHERS THEY HAD ON COARSE STRIPED DRESSES AND BIG GROTESQUE HEAVY SHOES I BURST INTO TEARS AS THEY LED ME AWAY
3259-158083-0047 NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAY FOLLOWING THEIR COMMITMENT TO OCCOQUAN MISTER O'BRIEN OF COUNSEL WAS DIRECTED TO SEE THE WOMEN TO ASCERTAIN THEIR CONDITION
3259-158083-0048 FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WERE ALARMED AS NOT A LINE OF NEWS HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO PENETRATE TO THE WORLD MISTER O'BRIEN WAS DENIED ADMISSION AND FORCED TO COME BACK TO WASHINGTON WITHOUT ANY REPORT WHATSOEVER

3259-158083-0051 THE TERRIBLE ANXIETY AT HEADQUARTERS WAS NOT RELIEVED THE THIRD DAY BY A REPORT BROUGHT FROM THE WORKHOUSE BY ONE OF THE MARINES STATIONED AT QUANTICO STATION VIRGINIA WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE WORKHOUSE ON THE NIGHT THE WOMEN ARRIVED
3259-158083-0052 HE BROUGHT NEWS THAT UNKNOWN TORTURES WERE GOING ON MISTER O'BRIEN IMMEDIATELY FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH BY A COURT ORDER
3259-158083-0053 AND WHICH WAS BEING CONTINUED AT THAT MOMENT MISS LUCY BURNS WHO HAD ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE WOMEN HAD MANAGED TO SECRETE SMALL SCRAPS OF PAPER AND A TINY PENCIL AND JOT DOWN BRIEFLY THE DAY BY DAY EVENTS AT THE WORKHOUSE

3259-158083-0055 SMUGGLED OUT OF THE WORKHOUSE MISS BURNS IS SO GIFTED A WRITER THAT I FEEL APOLOGETIC FOR USING THESE SCRAPS IN THEIR RAW FORM BUT I KNOW SHE WILL FORGIVE ME WEDNESDAY

3259-158083-0066 I HAD BEEN FORCIBLY EXAMINED BY DOCTOR GANNON I PROTESTING THAT I WISHED A WOMAN PHYSICIAN OF THIS EXPERIENCE MISS BURNS WROTE ON TINY SCRAPS OF PAPER WEDNESDAY
3259-158083-0067 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MISSUS LEWIS AND I WERE ASKED TO GO TO THE OPERATING ROOM WENT THERE AND FOUND OUR CLOTHES TOLD WE WERE TO GO TO WASHINGTON NO REASON AS USUAL WHEN WE WERE DRESSED DOCTOR GANNON APPEARED

3259-158083-0074 EACH ONE WAS CALLED TO THE MAT AND INTERROGATED WILL YOU WORK WILL YOU PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WILL YOU EAT WILL YOU STOP PICKETING WILL YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING YOUR FINE AND PROMISE NEVER TO PICKET AGAIN
3259-158083-0075 HOW BAFFLED HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER WAS DEFINITE AND FINAL THEIR RESISTANCE WAS SUPERB ONE OF THE FEW WARNING INCIDENTS DURING THE GRAY DAYS OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0076 WAS THE UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTORS
3259-158083-0077 I HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN RUSSIA UNDERGO EXTREME SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEALS BUT UNLESS I HAD SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
3259-158083-0078 MY SISTER HUNGER STRUCK IN RUSSIA WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF TWO OF HER FRIENDS INDICTED FOR A GOVERNMENT OFFENSE SHE WAS FED AFTER THREE DAYS
3259-158083-0079 YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
3259-158083-0080 AND FORCE THE HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT
3259-158083-0081 TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A SPECIAL ORDER TO VISIT HER DAUGHTER FAILING TO SECURE THIS SHE WENT DAILY TO MISTER TUMULTY'S OFFICE ASKING IF HE HIMSELF WOULD NOT INTERCEDE FOR HER
3259-158083-0082 THE STORIES OF THE INHUMAN TREATMENT AT OCCOQUAN WERE FALSE AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BELIEVE THEM FINALLY MISSUS YOUNG PLEADED TO BE ALLOWED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WARM CLOTHING TO HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE TOO LIGHTLY CLAD FOR THE VIGOROUS TEMPERATURE OF NOVEMBER
3259-158083-0083 MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
3259-158083-0084 MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN WAS AMONG THE WOMEN WHO ENDURED THE NIGHT OF TERROR MISSUS BRANNAN IS THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES A DANA FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK SUN AND THAT GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT OF LIBERTY WHO WAS A TRUSTED ASSOCIATE AND COUNSELOR
3259-158083-0085 OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN MISSUS BRANNAN LIFE LONG SUFFRAGIST IS AN ARISTOCRAT OF INTELLECT AND FEELING WHO HAS ALWAYS ALLIED HERSELF WITH LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENTS THIS WAS HER SECOND TERM OF IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0086 SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
3259-158083-0087 SEIZE THESE WOMEN TAKE THEM OFF THAT ONE THAT ONE TAKE HER OFF THE GUARDS RUSHED FORWARD AND AN ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE SCENE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION ENSUED I SAW ONE OF THE GUARDS SEIZE HER LUCY BURNS
3259-158083-0088 BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
3259-158083-0089 AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
3259-158083-0090 I SAW THE GUARDS SEIZING THE DIFFERENT WOMEN OF THE PARTY WITH THE UTMOST VIOLENCE THE FURNITURE BEING OVERTURNED AND THE ROOM A SCENE OF THE UTMOST DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0091 I SAW MISS LINCOLN LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF HAVING JUST BEEN THROWN DOWN BY THE TWO GUARDS WHO WERE STANDING OVER HER IN A MENACING ATTITUDE SEEING THE GENERAL DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0092 I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
3259-158083-0093 TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING DURING ALL OF THIS TIME SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER WAS DIRECTING THE WHOLE ATTACK ALL OF US WERE THROWN INTO DIFFERENT CELLS IN THE MEN'S PRISON I BEING PUT IN ONE WITH FOUR OTHER WOMEN THE CELL CONTAINING A NARROW BED
3259-158083-0094 AND ONE CHAIR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE BEING FORCED INTO THE CELLS THE GUARDS KEPT UP AN UPROAR SHOUTING BANGING THE IRON DOORS CLANGING BARS MAKING A TERRIFYING NOISE
3259-158083-0095 I AND ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WERE LYING DOWN ON THE NARROW BED ON WHICH WERE A BLANKET AND ONE PILLOW THE DOOR OF THE CELL WAS OPENED AND A MATTRESS AND A BLANKET BEING THROWN IN THE DOOR WAS VIOLENTLY BANGED TO
3259-158083-0096 AND LAY DOWN COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THE BLANKET I LOOKED ACROSS THE CORRIDOR AND SAW MISS LINCOLN AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS ALL RIGHT BEING ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN HURT BY THE TREATMENT IN THE OFFICE BUILDING INSTANTLY SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER RUSHED FORWARD SHOUTING AT ME
3259-158083-0097 GAG YOU AND PUT YOU IN A STRAITJACKET I WISH TO STATE AGAIN THAT THE CELLS INTO WHICH WE WERE PUT WERE SITUATED IN THE MEN'S PRISON
3259-158083-0098 AND WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT LOOK AT US FURTHERMORE THE WATER CLOSETS WERE IN FULL VIEW OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER AND THE GUARDS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE FLUSHING OF THESE CLOSETS COULD ONLY BE DONE FROM THE CORRIDOR AND WE WERE FORCED TO ASK THE GUARDS TO DO THIS FOR US
3259-158083-0099 THE MEN WHO HAD SHORTLY BEFORE ATTACKED US
3259-158083-0100 I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
3259-158083-0101 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0102 AND THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT THE MATRON AND GUARDS WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ACT TOWARDS US AS THEY HAD ACTED UNLESS THEY RELIED UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FROM THE TIME WE REACHED THE WORKHOUSE TO TERRORIZE US AND MY FEAR
3259-158083-0103 LEST THE EXTREME OF OUTRAGE WOULD BE WORKED UPON THE YOUNG GIRLS OF OUR PARTY BECAME INTENSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE TERROR OF THAT NIGHT
3259-158083-0104 THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
3259-158083-0105 AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO LIE DOWN FEELING SO ILL I COULD NOT SLEEP HAVING A SENSE OF CONSTANT DANGER I WAS ALMOST PARALYZED AND IN WRETCHED PHYSICAL CONDITION
3259-158083-0106 SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
3259-158083-0107 ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
3259-158083-0108 AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE
3259-158083-0109 THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
3259-158083-0110 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
3259-158083-0111 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP THIS GROUP AWAY FROM ALICE PAUL AND HER COMPANIONS AS THEY COUNTED ON HANDLING THE REBELLION MORE EASILY IN TWO GROUPS THAN ONE MEANWHILE THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS IN THE WORKHOUSE GREW STEADILY WORSE
3259-158083-0112 WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO OBTAIN A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS A HURRIED JOURNEY BY COUNSEL TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE WADDILL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA BROUGHT THE WRIT
3259-158083-0113 IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
3259-158083-0114 THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK MORE MELODRAMATIC THAN THE MOST STIRRING MOVING PICTURE FILM ALTHOUGH THE WRIT HAD BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE GREATEST SECRECY
3259-158083-0115 A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
3259-158083-0116 NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
3259-158083-0117 IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
3259-158083-0118 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
3259-158083-0119 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS
3259-158083-0120 IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT
3259-158083-0121 SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
3259-158083-0122 WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
3259-158083-0123 THE WOMEN SUSPECTED HIS SOLICITUDE AND REFUSED TO MAKE ANY PROMISE WHATSOEVER WITHOUT FIRST BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE THE WRIT ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO BUT FOR US IT DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TASK
3259-158083-0124 A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
3259-158083-0125 WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
