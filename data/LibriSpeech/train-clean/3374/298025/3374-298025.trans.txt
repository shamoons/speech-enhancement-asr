3374-298025-0000 AN OLD MAN IN AGONY BUT STILL GENIAL AND FULL OF DELICATE WIT DRAPES THE MOTLEY SPECTACLE OF HIS LIFELIKE WRITINGS WITH THE COSTLY TAPESTRY OF A PREFACE WHICH IN ITSELF IS A BEAUTIFUL AND ROMANTIC PAINTING
3374-298025-0001 BUT WHAT SHALL MY SPIRIT BESTOW UPON ITS OFFSPRING WHICH LIKE ITS PARENT IS AS POOR IN POESY AS IT IS RICH IN LOVE JUST ONE WORD A PARTING TROPE
3374-298025-0002 IT IS NOT ALONE THE ROYAL EAGLE WHO MAY DESPISE THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN THE SWAN TOO IS PROUD AND TAKES NO NOTE OF IT
3374-298025-0003 HUMAN BEINGS AND WHAT THEY WANT AND DO
3374-298025-0004 A FRESH WARM BREATH OF LIFE AND LOVE FANNED ME RUSTLING AND STIRRING IN ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE VERDANT GROVE I GAZED AND ENJOYED IT ALL THE RICH GREEN THE WHITE BLOSSOMS AND THE GOLDEN FRUIT
3374-298025-0005 AND IN MY MIND'S EYE I SAW TOO IN MANY FORMS MY ONE AND ONLY BELOVED NOW AS A LITTLE GIRL NOW AS A YOUNG LADY IN THE FULL BLOOM AND ENERGY OF LOVE AND WOMANHOOD
3374-298025-0006 AND NOW AS A DIGNIFIED MOTHER WITH HER DEMURE BABE IN HER ARMS I BREATHED THE SPRING AND I SAW CLEARLY ALL ABOUT ME EVERLASTING YOUTH SMILING I SAID TO MYSELF
3374-298025-0007 FROM THIS FEELING OR THOUGHT NOTHING COULD HAVE TURNED ME NEITHER GENERAL DESPAIR NOR PERSONAL FEAR FOR I BELIEVED
3374-298025-0008 BUT I GLADLY LOST MYSELF IN ALL THOSE BLENDINGS AND INTERTWININGS OF JOY AND PAIN FROM WHICH SPRING THE SPICE OF LIFE AND THE FLOWER OF FEELING SPIRITUAL PLEASURE AS WELL AS SENSUAL BLISS
3374-298025-0009 A SUBTLE FIRE FLOWED THROUGH MY VEINS
3374-298025-0010 IT WAS NOT ONLY THE WISH TO RELIEVE THE TORMENTING STING OF MY DESIRE AND TO COOL THE SWEET FIRE BY GRATIFICATION IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR LIPS THAT I LONGED OR FOR YOUR EYES OR FOR YOUR BODY
3374-298025-0011 A MARVELOUS MINGLING OF MEMORIES AND DESIRES ALL THE MYSTERIES OF CAPRICE IN MAN AND WOMAN SEEMED TO HOVER ABOUT ME WHEN SUDDENLY IN MY SOLITUDE
3374-298025-0012 AND YET WITH CALM PRESENCE OF MIND I WATCHED FOR THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF JOY IN YOU SO THAT NOT ONE SHOULD ESCAPE ME TO IMPAIR THE HARMONY I NOT ONLY ENJOYED BUT I FELT AND ENJOYED
3374-298025-0013 THE ENJOYMENT YOU ARE SO EXTRAORDINARILY CLEVER DEAREST LUCINDA THAT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS LONG ERE THIS BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ALL NOTHING BUT A BEAUTIFUL DREAM
3374-298025-0014 NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW HOW LONG I DO NOT KNOW FOR ALONG WITH THE OTHER RULES OF REASON AND MORALITY I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE LAPSE OF TIME WELL I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT INTO THE OPEN
3374-298025-0015 THE MORNING CERTAINLY DESERVES TO BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL THE AIR IS STILL AND QUITE WARM AND THE VERDURE HERE BEFORE ME IS FRESH AND EVEN AS THE WIDE LAND UNDULATES IN HILLS AND DALES
3374-298025-0016 SO THE CALM BROAD SILVERY RIVER WINDS ALONG IN GREAT BENDS AND SWEEPS UNTIL IT AND THE LOVER'S FANTASY CRADLED UPON IT LIKE THE SWAN PASS AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE AND LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298025-0017 MY VISION DOUBTLESS OWES THE GROVE AND ITS SOUTHERN COLOR EFFECT TO THE HUGE MASS OF FLOWERS HERE BESIDE ME
3374-298025-0018 ALL THE REST IS READILY EXPLAINED BY PSYCHOLOGY
3374-298025-0019 ALL EXCEPT THAT NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND DOING NOTHING AND THAT I AM NOW SITTING HERE AND DOING SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING PERHAPS EVEN LESS
3374-298025-0020 I WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF UNFOLDING TO YOU IN CLEAR AND PRECISE PERIODS THE EXACT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HISTORY OF OUR FRIVOLITIES AND OF MY DULNESS I WAS GOING TO EXPOUND TO YOU STEP BY STEP
3374-298025-0021 IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT ATTACK THE HIDDEN CENTRE OF THE LOVELIEST EXISTENCE AND TO CONFESS TO YOU THE MANIFOLD EFFECTS OF MY AWKWARDNESS
3374-298025-0022 I WAS ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE APPRENTICESHIP OF MY MANHOOD
3374-298025-0023 A PERIOD WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE OR IN PARTS I CAN NEVER LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INWARD AMUSEMENT A LITTLE MELANCHOLY AND CONSIDERABLE SELF SATISFACTION
3374-298025-0024 STILL AS A REFINED LOVER AND WRITER I WILL ENDEAVOR TO REFASHION THE COARSE OCCURRENCE AND ADAPT IT TO MY PURPOSE FOR ME AND FOR THIS BOOK HOWEVER FOR MY LOVE OF IT AND FOR ITS INNER DEVELOPMENT
3374-298025-0025 THERE IS NO BETTER ADAPTATION OF MEANS TO ENDS THAN THIS NAMELY THAT RIGHT AT THE START I BEGIN BY ABOLISHING WHAT WE CALL ORDERLY ARRANGEMENT KEEP MYSELF ENTIRELY ALOOF FROM IT
3374-298025-0026 FRANKLY CLAIMING AND ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO A CHARMING CONFUSION THIS IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL WHICH OUR LIFE AND LOVE OFFERS TO MY SPIRIT AND TO MY PEN IS SO INCESSANTLY PROGRESSIVE
3374-298025-0027 AND SO INFLEXIBLY SYSTEMATIC IF THE FORM WERE ALSO OF THAT CHARACTER THIS IN ITS WAY UNIQUE LETTER WOULD THEN ACQUIRE AN INTOLERABLE UNITY AND MONOTONY
3374-298025-0028 SO I USE MY INCONTESTABLE RIGHT TO A CONFUSED STYLE BY INSERTING HERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ONE OF THE MANY INCOHERENT SHEETS WHICH I ONCE FILLED WITH RUBBISH
3374-298025-0029 IT WAS WRITTEN IN A MOOD OF IMPATIENT LONGING DUE TO MY NOT FINDING YOU WHERE I MOST SURELY EXPECTED TO FIND YOU IN YOUR ROOM ON OUR SOFA IN THE HAPHAZARD WORDS SUGGESTED BY THE PEN YOU HAD LATELY BEEN USING
3374-298025-0030 THE SELECTION IS NOT DIFFICULT FOR SINCE AMONG THE DREAMY FANCIES WHICH ARE HERE CONFIDED TO YOU IN PERMANENT LETTERS THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD
3374-298025-0031 IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND HAS A CERTAIN SORT OF RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT THEY CALL THOUGHT I CHOOSE IN PREFERENCE TO ANYTHING ELSE A DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE MOST LOVELY OF SITUATIONS
3374-298025-0032 FOR ONCE WE KNOW TO A CERTAINTY THAT WE LIVE IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD THE NEXT NEED IS OBVIOUS
