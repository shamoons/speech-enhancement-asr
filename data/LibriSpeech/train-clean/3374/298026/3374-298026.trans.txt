3374-298026-0000 IT LOOKS AT ME JOYOUSLY OUT OF ITS DEEP EYES AND OPENS ITS ARMS TO EMBRACE MY SPIRIT
3374-298026-0001 THE HOLIEST AND MOST EVANESCENT OF THOSE DELICATE TRAITS AND UTTERANCES OF THE SOUL WHICH TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE HIGHEST SEEM LIKE BLISS ITSELF
3374-298026-0002 ARE MERELY THE COMMON ATMOSPHERE OF OUR SPIRITUAL BREATH AND LIFE THE WORDS ARE WEAK AND VAGUE
3374-298026-0003 FURTHERMORE IN THIS THRONG OF IMPRESSIONS I COULD ONLY REPEAT ANEW THE ONE INEXHAUSTIBLE FEELING OF OUR ORIGINAL HARMONY A GREAT FUTURE BECKONS ME ON INTO THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298026-0004 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0005 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
3374-298026-0006 THE BLOOD RUSHES WILDLY THROUGH MY SWOLLEN VEINS MY MOUTH THIRSTS FOR THE CONTACT OF YOUR LIPS AND MY FANCY SEEKS VAINLY AMONG THE MANY FORMS OF JOY FOR ONE
3374-298026-0007 WHICH MIGHT AT LAST GRATIFY MY DESIRE AND GIVE IT REST AND THEN AGAIN I SUDDENLY AND SADLY BETHINK ME OF THE GLOOMY TIME WHEN I WAS ALWAYS WAITING WITHOUT HOPE
3374-298026-0008 AND MADLY LOVING WITHOUT KNOWING IT WHEN MY INNERMOST BEING OVERFLOWED WITH A VAGUE LONGING WHICH IT BREATHED FORTH BUT RARELY IN HALF SUPPRESSED SIGHS
3374-298026-0009 OH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL A FAIRY TALE THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH JOY SUCH LOVE AS I NOW FEEL AND SUCH A WOMAN WHO COULD BE MY MOST TENDER BELOVED MY BEST COMPANION AND AT THE SAME TIME
3374-298026-0010 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0011 YOU KNOW NOTHING THE WOMANLINESS OF YOUR SOUL ASIDE FROM MINOR PECULIARITIES CONSISTS IN ITS REGARDING LIFE AND LOVE AS THE SAME THING FOR YOU ALL FEELING IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL
3374-298026-0012 YOU RECOGNIZE NO SEPARATIONS YOUR BEING IS AN INDIVISIBLE UNITY THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO SERIOUS AND SO JOYOUS WHY YOU REGARD EVERYTHING IN SUCH A LARGE AND INDIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0013 THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE ME ALL OF ME AND WILL SURRENDER NO PART OF ME TO THE STATE TO POSTERITY OR TO MANLY PLEASURES I AM ALL YOURS WE ARE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
3374-298026-0014 AND WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER YOU ACCOMPANY ME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF MANHOOD FROM THE UTMOST WANTONNESS TO THE MOST REFINED SPIRITUALITY IN YOU ALONE I FIRST SAW TRUE PRIDE
3374-298026-0015 AND TRUE FEMININE HUMILITY THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING IF IT IS ONLY SURROUNDED WITHOUT SEPARATING US
3374-298026-0016 WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
3374-298026-0017 LIKE OUR LOVE ARE IMMORTAL I CAN NO LONGER SAY MY LOVE AND YOUR LOVE THEY ARE BOTH ALIKE IN THEIR PERFECT MUTUALITY MARRIAGE IS THE EVERLASTING UNITY AND ALLIANCE OF OUR SPIRITS
3374-298026-0018 AS THAT LAST GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE WE DRANK TOGETHER WHEN I SAID AND SO LET US DRINK OUT THE REST OF OUR LIVES
3374-298026-0019 AND SO I SAY AGAIN LET US LIVE AND LOVE I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SURVIVE ME YOU WOULD RATHER FOLLOW YOUR DYING HUSBAND INTO HIS COFFIN GLADLY AND LOVINGLY WOULD YOU DESCEND INTO THE BURNING ABYSS
3374-298026-0020 EVEN AS THE WOMEN OF INDIA DO IMPELLED BY A MAD LAW THE CRUEL CONSTRAINING PURPOSE OF WHICH DESECRATES AND DESTROYS THE MOST DELICATE SANCTITIES OF THE WILL
3374-298026-0021 ON THE OTHER SIDE PERHAPS LONGING WILL BE MORE COMPLETELY REALIZED I OFTEN WONDER OVER IT EVERY THOUGHT AND WHATEVER ELSE IS FASHIONED WITHIN US
3374-298026-0022 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0023 AND THEN AGAIN COME MOMENTS OF SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL CLARITY WHEN SEVERAL SUCH SPIRITS OF THE INNER WORLD COMPLETELY FUSE TOGETHER INTO A WONDERFUL WEDLOCK AND MANY A FORGOTTEN BIT OF OUR EGO SHINES FORTH IN A NEW LIGHT
3374-298026-0024 AND EVEN ILLUMINATES THE DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE WITH ITS BRIGHT LUSTRE AS IT IS IN A SMALL WAY
3374-298026-0025 I THINK IN A LARGE WAY THAT WHICH WE CALL A LIFE IS FOR THE COMPLETE INNER IMMORTAL MAN ONLY A SINGLE IDEA AN INDIVISIBLE FEELING
3374-298026-0026 AND FOR HIM THERE COME TOO MOMENTS OF THE PROFOUNDEST AND FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN ALL LIVES FALL TOGETHER AND MINGLE AND SEPARATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0027 THE TIME IS COMING WHEN WE TWO SHALL BEHOLD IN ONE SPIRIT THAT WE ARE BLOSSOMS OF ONE PLANT OR PETALS OF ONE FLOWER WE SHALL THEN KNOW WITH A SMILE
3374-298026-0028 THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL MERELY HOPE WAS REALLY MEMORY DO YOU KNOW HOW THE FIRST SEED OF THIS IDEA GERMINATED IN MY SOUL BEFORE YOU AND TOOK ROOT IN YOURS
3374-298026-0029 WEAVE OUR LOVE EVER AND EVER MORE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY TOGETHER JUST AS A CHILD LIKE AN ECHO DOUBLES THE HAPPINESS OF ITS GENTLE PARENTS NOTHING CAN PART US
3374-298026-0030 AND CERTAINLY ANY SEPARATION WOULD ONLY DRAW ME MORE POWERFULLY TO YOU I BETHINK ME HOW AT OUR LAST EMBRACE YOU VEHEMENTLY RESISTING I BURST INTO SIMULTANEOUS TEARS AND LAUGHTER
3374-298026-0031 I TRIED TO CALM MYSELF AND IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SEPARATED FROM YOU UNTIL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS CONVINCED ME OF IT AGAINST MY WILL
3374-298026-0032 BUT THEN MY LONGING GREW AGAIN IRRESISTIBLE UNTIL ON ITS WINGS I SANK BACK INTO YOUR ARMS SUPPOSE WORDS OR A HUMAN BEING TO CREATE A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3374-298026-0033 THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
3374-298026-0034 WE HAVE TO COOL AND MITIGATE THE CONSUMING FIRE WITH JESTS AND THUS FOR US THE MOST WITTY OF THE FORMS AND SITUATIONS OF JOY IS ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
3374-298026-0035 IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
3374-298026-0036 INTO COMPLETE HUMANITY THAT WAS MY DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE LOVELIEST SITUATION IN THE LOVELIEST OF WORLDS I KNOW RIGHT WELL WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF IT
3374-298026-0037 AND HOW YOU TOOK IT AT THAT TIME AND I THINK I KNOW JUST AS WELL WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF IT AND HOW YOU WILL TAKE IT HERE HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK IN WHICH YOU EXPECT TO FIND GENUINE HISTORY PLAIN TRUTH AND CALM REASON
3374-298026-0038 YES EVEN MORALITY THE CHARMING MORALITY OF LOVE
3374-298026-0039 HOW CAN A MAN WISH TO WRITE ANYTHING WHICH IT IS SCARCELY PERMISSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE FELT
3374-298026-0040 I REPLIED
3374-298026-0041 A MAN FEELS IT HE MUST WISH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHAT A MAN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT HE MAY WRITE
3374-298026-0042 I WANTED FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE ORIGINAL AND ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN A CERTAIN AWKWARD ENTHUSIASM WHICH LIKES TO UTTER BOLDLY THAT WHICH IS DELICATE AND HOLY
3374-298026-0043 AND SOMETIMES FALLS HEADLONG OVER ITS OWN HONEST ZEAL AND SPEAKS A WORD THAT IS DIVINE TO THE POINT OF COARSENESS THIS APOLOGY WOULD INDEED SAVE ME
3374-298026-0044 BUT PERHAPS ONLY AT THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF MY MANHOOD ITSELF FOR WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY MANHOOD IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE NEVERTHELESS A GREAT DEAL AGAINST THE SEX IN GENERAL
3374-298026-0045 MEANTIME I WILL BY NO MEANS MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH THEM BUT WILL RATHER EXCUSE AND DEFEND MY LIBERTY AND AUDACITY BY MEANS OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE LITTLE INNOCENT WILHELMINA
3374-298026-0046 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
