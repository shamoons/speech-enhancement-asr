3374-298032-0000 THE CHILDREN ARE JUSTIFIED WHEN THEY PEEP SO CURIOUSLY AND TIMIDLY AT A COMPANY OF UNKNOWN FACES EACH INDIVIDUAL ATOM OF EVERLASTING TIME IS CAPABLE OF COMPRISING A WORLD OF JOY
3374-298032-0001 AND AT THE SAME TIME OF OPENING UP A FATHOMLESS ABYSS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING
3374-298032-0002 I UNDERSTAND NOW THE OLD FAIRY TALE ABOUT THE MAN WHOM THE SORCERER ALLOWED TO LIVE A GREAT MANY YEARS IN A FEW MOMENTS FOR I KNOW BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE TERRIBLE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE FANTASY
3374-298032-0003 SINCE THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER IT IS THREE DAYS NOW I HAVE UNDERGONE THE SUFFERINGS OF AN ENTIRE LIFE FROM THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OF GLOWING YOUTH TO THE PALE MOONLIGHT OF SAGACIOUS OLD AGE
3374-298032-0004 EVERY LITTLE DETAIL SHE WROTE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS TAKEN WITH WHAT I HAD ALREADY GLEANED FROM THE DOCTOR AND HAD OBSERVED MYSELF CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THAT IT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU THOUGHT
3374-298032-0005 INDEED NO LONGER DANGEROUS BUT DECIDED PAST HOPE LOST IN THIS THOUGHT AND MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HURRYING TO YOUR SIDE
3374-298032-0006 MY STATE OF MIND WAS REALLY VERY DISCONSOLATE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY WAS BEING NEW BORN BY THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT YOU ARE WELL AGAIN
3374-298032-0007 I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
3374-298032-0008 FLOWERS HAD STARTED TO GROW ON THE BELOVED GRAVE AND MY TEARS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FLOW MORE GENTLY MUTE AND ALONE I STOOD AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FEATURES I HAD LOVED AND THE SWEET GLANCES OF THE EXPRESSIVE EYES
3374-298032-0009 NOW AND THEN THE PALE FACE SMILED AND SEEMED ASLEEP JUST AS IT HAD LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW IT THEN OF A SUDDEN THE DIFFERENT MEMORIES ALL BECAME CONFUSED
3374-298032-0010 WITH UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY THE OUTLINES CHANGED REASSUMED THEIR FIRST FORM AND TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE WILD VISION VANISHED
3374-298032-0011 ONLY YOUR HOLY EYES REMAINED IN THE EMPTY SPACE AND HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS EVEN AS THE FRIENDLY STARS SHINE ETERNALLY OVER OUR POVERTY
3374-298032-0012 NOW A PIERCING PAIN FROM DARK SUNS BURNED ME WITH AN INSUPPORTABLE GLARE NOW A BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE HOVERED ABOUT AS IF TO ENTICE ME THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL A FRESH BREATH OF MORNING AIR FAN ME
3374-298032-0013 I HELD MY HEAD UP AND CRIED ALOUD
3374-298032-0014 WHY SHOULD YOU TORMENT YOURSELF IN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN BE WITH HER
3374-298032-0015 I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
3374-298032-0016 UNWORTHY MAN YOU CANNOT EVEN ENDURE THE TRIFLING DISSONANCES OF THIS ORDINARY LIFE AND YET YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS READY FOR AND WORTHY OF A HIGHER LIFE GO AWAY AND DO AND SUFFER AS YOUR CALLING IS
3374-298032-0017 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0018 IS IT NOT TO YOU ALSO REMARKABLE HOW EVERYTHING ON THIS EARTH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTRE HOW ORDERLY EVERYTHING IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT AND TRIVIAL SO IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
3374-298032-0019 AND FOR THAT REASON I SUSPECT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE ALREADY IMPARTED MY SUSPICION TO YOU THAT THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE LARGER AND IN THE GOOD AS WELL AS IN THE BAD STRONGER WILDER BOLDER AND MORE TREMENDOUS
3374-298032-0020 AS WHEN A PERSON SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE MIDST OF IMMEASURABLE MOUNTAINS OF ICE EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND IN ME WAS COLD AND STRANGE AND EVEN MY TEARS FROZE
3374-298032-0021 WONDERFUL WORLDS APPEARED AND VANISHED BEFORE ME IN MY UNEASY DREAM I WAS SICK AND SUFFERED GREAT PAIN BUT I LOVED MY SICKNESS AND WELCOMED THE SUFFERING
3374-298032-0022 I HATED EVERYTHING EARTHLY AND WAS GLAD TO SEE IT ALL PUNISHED AND DESTROYED I FELT SO ALONE AND SO STRANGELY
3374-298032-0023 AND AS A DELICATE SPIRIT OFTEN GROWS MELANCHOLY IN THE VERY LAP OF HAPPINESS OVER ITS OWN JOY AND AT THE VERY ACME OF ITS EXISTENCE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF THE FUTILITY OF IT ALL
3374-298032-0024 SO DID I REGARD MY SUFFERING WITH MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE I REGARDED IT AS THE SYMBOL OF LIFE IN GENERAL I BELIEVED THAT I WAS SEEING AND FEELING THE EVERLASTING DISCORD
3374-298032-0025 AND THE LOVELY FORMS OF REFINED CULTURE SEEMED DEAD AND TRIVIAL TO ME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS MONSTROUS WORLD OF INFINITE STRENGTH AND OF UNENDING STRUGGLE AND WARFARE
3374-298032-0026 EVEN INTO THE MOST HIDDEN DEPTHS OF EXISTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REMARKABLE FEELING SICKNESS ACQUIRED THE CHARACTER OF A PECULIAR WORLD COMPLETE IN ITSELF
3374-298032-0027 I FELT THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS RICHER AND DEEPER THAN THE VULGAR HEALTH OF THE DREAMING SLEEP WALKERS ALL AROUND ME AND WITH THE SICKLINESS WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
3374-298032-0028 THIS FEELING ALSO CLUNG TO ME AND COMPLETELY SEPARATED ME FROM OTHER MEN JUST AS I WAS SUNDERED FROM THE EARTH BY THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR NATURE AND MY LOVE HAD BEEN TOO SACRED
3374-298032-0029 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL WAS RIGHT SO AND THAT YOUR UNAVOIDABLE DEATH WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A GENTLE AWAKENING AFTER A LIGHT SLEEP I TOO THOUGHT THAT I WAS AWAKE WHEN I SAW YOUR PICTURE
3374-298032-0030 WHICH EVERMORE TRANSFIGURED ITSELF INTO A CHEERFUL DIFFUSED PURITY SERIOUS AND YET CHARMING QUITE YOU AND YET NO LONGER YOU THE DIVINE FORM IRRADIATED BY A WONDERFUL LIGHT
3374-298032-0031 NOW IT WAS LIKE THE TERRIBLE GLEAM OF VISIBLE OMNIPOTENCE NOW LIKE A SOFT RAY OF GOLDEN CHILDHOOD
3374-298032-0032 BECAUSE EVERY EARTHLY SENTIMENT WAS ENTIRELY STRANGE TO ME AND THE FEELING NEVER LEFT ME THAT I WAS CONSECRATED TO DEATH
3374-298032-0033 THE YEARS PASSED SLOWLY BY AND DEEDS AND WORKS ADVANCED LABORIOUSLY TO THEIR GOAL ONE AFTER THE OTHER A GOAL THAT SEEMED AS LITTLE MINE AS THE DEEDS AND WORKS SEEMED TO BE WHAT THEY ARE CALLED
3374-298032-0034 TO ME THEY WERE MERELY HOLY SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY ONE BELOVED
3374-298032-0035 AND THE ONE ETERNAL AND INDIVISIBLE HUMANITY ALL EXISTENCE WAS AN UNINTERRUPTED DIVINE SERVICE OF SOLITARY LOVE
3374-298032-0036 FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
3374-298032-0037 THE BEST STRENGTH OF LIFE WAS GONE AND STILL ART AND VIRTUE
3374-298032-0038 STOOD EVER UNATTAINABLE BEFORE ME I SHOULD HAVE DESPAIRED HAD I NOT PERCEIVED AND IDOLIZED BOTH IN YOU GRACIOUS MADONNA AND YOU AND YOUR GENTLE GODLINESS IN MYSELF
3374-298032-0039 THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
3374-298032-0040 AN EARNEST LONGING FOR YOU AND FOR FREEDOM SEIZED ME I YEARNED FOR MY DEAR OLD FATHERLAND AND WAS ABOUT TO SHAKE OFF THE DUST OF TRAVEL WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY CALLED BACK TO LIFE BY THE PROMISE AND REASSURANCE OF YOUR RECOVERY
3374-298032-0041 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3374-298032-0042 BUT WHY POETICALLY CONCEIVE SINCE WE FIND THE GERM OF EVERYTHING IN OURSELVES AND YET REMAIN FOREVER ONLY A FRAGMENT OF OURSELVES
