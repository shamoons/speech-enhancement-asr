3436-172162-0006 SON TO KING BRADEMAGUS WHO LOVED QUEEN GUENEVER PASSING WELL AND SO HAD HE DONE LONG AND MANY YEARS NOW THIS KNIGHT SIR MALEAGANS LEARNED THE QUEEN'S PURPOSE AND THAT SHE HAD NO MEN OF ARMS WITH HER
3436-172162-0007 BUT THE TEN NOBLE KNIGHTS ALL ARRAYED IN GREEN FOR MAYING SO HE PREPARED HIM TWENTY MEN OF ARMS AND A HUNDRED ARCHERS TO TAKE CAPTIVE THE QUEEN AND HER KNIGHTS
3436-172162-0008 IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY IN A MORN AT BREAK OF DAY WITH A TROOP OF DAMSELS PLAYING THE QUEEN FORSOOTH WENT FORTH A MAYING OLD SONG SO WHEN THE QUEEN HAD MAYED

3436-172162-0011 THEN THE TEN KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE DREW THEIR SWORDS AND THE OTHER PARTY RUN AT THEM WITH THEIR SPEARS
3436-172162-0012 THEN THEY LASHED TOGETHER WITH SWORDS TILL SEVERAL WERE SMITTEN TO THE EARTH SO WHEN THE QUEEN SAW HER KNIGHTS THUS DOLEFULLY OPPRESSED AND NEEDS MUST BE SLAIN AT THE LAST THEN FOR PITY AND SORROW SHE CRIED SIR MALEAGANS
3436-172162-0013 SLAY NOT MY NOBLE KNIGHTS AND I WILL GO WITH YOU UPON THIS COVENANT THAT

3436-172162-0015 FOR HE DREADED LEST SIR LAUNCELOT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE THEN THE QUEEN PRIVILY CALLED UNTO HER A PAGE OF HER CHAMBER THAT WAS SWIFTLY HORSED TO WHOM SHE SAID GO THOU WHEN THOU SEEST THY TIME
3436-172162-0016 AND BEAR THIS RING UNTO SIR LAUNCELOT AND PRAY HIM AS HE LOVETH ME THAT HE WILL SEE ME AND RESCUE ME AND SPARE NOT THY HORSE SAID THE QUEEN NEITHER FOR WATER NOR FOR LAND
3436-172162-0017 AND LIGHTLY HE TOOK HIS HORSE WITH THE SPURS AND DEPARTED AS FAST AS HE MIGHT AND WHEN SIR MALEAGANS SAW HIM SO FLEE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS BY THE QUEEN'S COMMANDMENT FOR TO WARN SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0018 THEN THEY THAT WERE BEST HORSED CHASED HIM AND SHOT AT HIM BUT THE CHILD WENT FROM THEM ALL THEN SIR MALEAGANS SAID TO THE QUEEN MADAM YE ARE ABOUT TO BETRAY ME BUT I SHALL ARRANGE FOR SIR LAUNCELOT THAT HE SHALL NOT COME LIGHTLY AT YOU
3436-172162-0019 THEN HE RODE WITH HER AND THEM ALL TO HIS CASTLE IN ALL THE HASTE THAT THEY MIGHT AND BY THE WAY SIR MALEAGANS LAID IN AMBUSH THE BEST ARCHERS THAT HE HAD TO WAIT FOR SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0020 AND THE CHILD CAME TO WESTMINSTER AND FOUND SIR LAUNCELOT AND TOLD HIS MESSAGE AND DELIVERED HIM THE QUEEN'S RING ALAS SAID SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0021 UNLESS I MAY RESCUE THAT NOBLE LADY THEN EAGERLY HE ASKED HIS ARMOR AND PUT IT ON HIM AND MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AS FAST AS HE MIGHT
3436-172162-0022 AND MEN SAY HE TOOK THE WATER AT WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND MADE HIS HORSE SWIM OVER THAMES UNTO LAMBETH THEN WITHIN A WHILE HE CAME TO A WOOD WHERE WAS A NARROW WAY AND THERE THE ARCHERS WERE LAID IN AMBUSH
3436-172162-0023 AND THEY SHOT AT HIM AND SMOTE HIS HORSE SO THAT HE FELL THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LEFT HIS HORSE AND WENT ON FOOT BUT THERE LAY SO MANY DITCHES AND HEDGES BETWIXT THE ARCHERS AND HIM THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEDDLE WITH THEM
3436-172162-0024 ALAS FOR SHAME SAID SIR LAUNCELOT THAT EVER ONE KNIGHT SHOULD BETRAY ANOTHER BUT IT IS AN OLD SAW A GOOD MAN IS NEVER IN DANGER BUT WHEN HE IS IN DANGER OF A COWARD
3436-172162-0025 THEN SIR LAUNCELOT WENT AWHILE AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CUMBERED BY HIS ARMOR HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM THEN BY CHANCE THERE CAME BY HIM A CART THAT CAME THITHER TO FETCH WOOD
3436-172162-0026 CARTS WERE LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR CARRYING OFFAL AND FOR CONVEYING CRIMINALS TO EXECUTION BUT SIR LAUNCELOT TOOK NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HASTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESCUING THE QUEEN SO HE DEMANDED OF THE CARTER
3436-172162-0027 THAT HE SHOULD TAKE HIM IN AND CONVEY HIM AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE FOR A LIBERAL REWARD THE CARTER CONSENTED AND SIR LAUNCELOT PLACED HIMSELF IN THE CART AND ONLY LAMENTED THAT WITH MUCH JOLTING HE MADE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
3436-172162-0028 HE DREW NEAR TO SEE WHO IT MIGHT BE THEN SIR LAUNCELOT TOLD HIM HOW THE QUEEN HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND HOW IN HASTENING TO HER RESCUE HIS HORSE HAD BEEN DISABLED AND HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE CART RATHER THAN GIVE UP HIS ENTERPRISE
3436-172162-0029 THEN SIR GAWAIN SAID SURELY IT IS UNWORTHY OF A KNIGHT TO TRAVEL IN SUCH SORT BUT SIR LAUNCELOT HEEDED HIM NOT AT NIGHTFALL
3436-172162-0030 BUT TO ADMIT HIS COMPANION WHOM SHE SUPPOSED TO BE A CRIMINAL OR AT LEAST A PRISONER IT PLEASED HER NOT
3436-172162-0031 AT SUPPER SIR LAUNCELOT CAME NEAR BEING CONSIGNED TO THE KITCHEN
3436-172162-0032 NEITHER WOULD THE DAMSELS PREPARE A BED FOR HIM HE SEIZED THE FIRST HE FOUND UNOCCUPIED AND WAS LEFT UNDISTURBED NEXT MORNING HE SAW FROM THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE A TRAIN ACCOMPANYING A LADY WHOM HE IMAGINED TO BE THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0033 THE LADY OF THE CASTLE SUPPLIED SIR LAUNCELOT WITH A HORSE AND THEY TRAVERSED THE PLAIN AT FULL SPEED THEY LEARNED FROM SOME TRAVELLERS WHOM THEY MET THAT THERE WERE TWO ROADS WHICH LED TO THE CASTLE OF SIR MALEAGANS HERE THEREFORE THE FRIENDS SEPARATED
3436-172162-0034 SIR LAUNCELOT FOUND HIS WAY BESET WITH OBSTACLES WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED SUCCESSFULLY BUT NOT WITHOUT MUCH LOSS OF TIME AS EVENING APPROACHED HE WAS MET BY A YOUNG AND SPORTIVE DAMSEL WHO GAYLY PROPOSED TO HIM A SUPPER
3436-172162-0035 AT HER CASTLE THE KNIGHT WHO WAS HUNGRY AND WEARY ACCEPTED THE OFFER THOUGH WITH NO VERY GOOD GRACE HE FOLLOWED THE LADY TO HER CASTLE AND ATE VORACIOUSLY OF HER SUPPER BUT WAS QUITE IMPENETRABLE TO ALL HER AMOROUS ADVANCES
3436-172162-0036 SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED AND HE WAS ASSAILED BY SIX FURIOUS RUFFIANS WHOM HE DEALT WITH SO VIGOROUSLY THAT MOST OF THEM WERE SPEEDILY DISABLED WHEN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHANGE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH HIS FAIR HOSTESS
3436-172162-0037 WHICH SHE TOLD HIM WOULD BY ITS CHANGES OF COLOR DISCLOSE TO HIM ALL ENCHANTMENTS AND ENABLE HIM TO SUBDUE THEM SIR LAUNCELOT PURSUED HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT BEING MUCH INCOMMODED EXCEPT BY THE TAUNTS OF TRAVELLERS
3436-172162-0038 WHO ALL SEEMED TO HAVE LEARNED BY SOME MEANS HIS DISGRACEFUL DRIVE IN THE CART ONE MORE INSOLENT THAN THE REST HAD THE AUDACITY TO INTERRUPT HIM DURING DINNER AND EVEN TO RISK A BATTLE IN SUPPORT OF HIS PLEASANTRY LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0039 AFTER AN EASY VICTORY ONLY DOOMED HIM TO BE CARTED IN HIS TURN AT NIGHT HE WAS RECEIVED AT ANOTHER CASTLE WITH GREAT APPARENT HOSPITALITY BUT FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MORNING IN A DUNGEON AND LOADED WITH CHAINS
3436-172162-0040 CONSULTING HIS RING AND FINDING THAT THIS WAS AN ENCHANTMENT HE BURST HIS CHAINS SEIZED HIS ARMOR IN SPITE OF THE VISIONARY MONSTERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND IT BROKE OPEN THE GATES OF THE TOWER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY
3436-172162-0041 AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
3436-172162-0042 PASSED OVER THE BRIDGE AND WAS ATTACKED AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE BANK BY A LION AND A LEOPARD BOTH OF WHICH HE SLEW AND THEN EXHAUSTED AND BLEEDING SEATED HIMSELF ON THE GRASS AND ENDEAVORED TO BIND UP HIS WOUNDS
3436-172162-0043 OFFERED HIM HIS ASSISTANCE AND INFORMED HIM THAT THE QUEEN WAS SAFE IN HIS CASTLE BUT COULD ONLY BE RESCUED BY ENCOUNTERING MALEAGANS LAUNCELOT DEMANDED THE BATTLE FOR THE NEXT DAY AND ACCORDINGLY IT TOOK PLACE AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER
3436-172162-0044 AND UNDER THE EYES OF THE FAIR CAPTIVE LAUNCELOT WAS ENFEEBLED BY HIS WOUNDS AND FOUGHT NOT WITH HIS USUAL SPIRIT AND THE CONTEST FOR A TIME WAS DOUBTFUL
3436-172162-0045 AH LAUNCELOT MY KNIGHT TRULY HAVE I BEEN TOLD THAT THOU ART NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME THESE WORDS INSTANTLY REVIVED THE DROOPING KNIGHT HE RESUMED AT ONCE HIS USUAL SUPERIORITY AND SOON LAID AT HIS FEET HIS HAUGHTY ADVERSARY
3436-172162-0046 MOVED BY THE ENTREATIES OF BRADEMAGUS ORDERED HIM TO WITHHOLD THE BLOW AND HE OBEYED THE CASTLE AND ITS PRISONERS WERE NOW AT HIS DISPOSAL LAUNCELOT HASTENED TO THE APARTMENT OF THE QUEEN THREW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
3436-172162-0047 AND WAS ABOUT TO KISS HER HAND WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED AH LAUNCELOT WHY DO I SEE THEE AGAIN YET FEEL THEE TO BE NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME AFTER HAVING BEEN DISGRACEFULLY DRAWN ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A SHE HAD NOT TIME TO FINISH THE PHRASE
3436-172162-0048 FOR HER LOVER SUDDENLY STARTED FROM HER AND BITTERLY LAMENTING THAT HE HAD INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF HIS SOVEREIGN LADY RUSHED OUT OF THE CASTLE THREW HIS SWORD AND HIS SHIELD TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT RAN FURIOUSLY INTO THE WOODS AND DISAPPEARED
3436-172162-0049 IT SEEMS THAT THE STORY OF THE ABOMINABLE CART WHICH HAUNTED LAUNCELOT AT EVERY STEP HAD REACHED THE EARS OF SIR KAY WHO HAD TOLD IT TO THE QUEEN AS A PROOF THAT HER KNIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN DISHONORED
3436-172162-0050 THREE DAYS ELAPSED DURING WHICH LAUNCELOT WANDERED WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WENT TILL AT LAST HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DECEIVED BY MISREPRESENTATION
3436-172162-0051 AND THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO SET HER RIGHT HE THEREFORE RETURNED COMPELLED MALEAGANS TO RELEASE HIS PRISONERS
3436-172162-0052 HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MEETING HIM THE NEXT DAY
