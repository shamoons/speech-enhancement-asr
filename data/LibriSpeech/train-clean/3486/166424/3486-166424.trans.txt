3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0002 THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0005 I DROPPED OVER THE SIDE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE ROAD UP WHICH BUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE HAD STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY PACED FARTHER AND FARTHER WITH AN INCREASING CONFIDENCE AND A GROWING WONDER
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0008 A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
3486-166424-0010 AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL
3486-166424-0011 THE RUSH WAS CHECKED FOR AN INSTANT MILLING UPON THE ROAD DICK I CRIED RUSH RUTH OVER TO THE TUNNEL MOUTH WE'LL FOLLOW WE CAN HOLD THEM THERE I'LL GET MARTIN CHIU MING AFTER THE PONY QUICK I PUSHED THE TWO OVER THE RIM OF THE HOLLOW
3486-166424-0012 QUICK MART I SHOUTED UP THE SHATTERED STAIRWAY WE CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLLOW RUTH AND DRAKE ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAK WE CAME THROUGH HURRY ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE HE CALLED I HEARD HIM EMPTY HIS MAGAZINE WITH ALMOST MACHINE GUN QUICKNESS
3486-166424-0013 ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
3486-166424-0014 AS WE SPED AFTER HIM I LOOKED BACK THE HORSEMEN HAD RECOVERED WERE NOW A SCANT HALF MILE FROM WHERE THE ROAD SWEPT PAST THE FORTRESS I SAW THAT WITH THEIR SWORDS THE HORSEMEN BORE GREAT BOWS A LITTLE CLOUD OF ARROWS SPARKLED FROM THEM
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0017 SCATTERED PRONE AMONG THESE WERE MEN AND HORSES OTHERS STAGGERED SCREAMING ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS STONY DIKE OUR PURSUERS WERE HELD LIKE RUSHING WATERS BEHIND A SUDDEN FALLEN TREE TIMED TO A SECOND CRIED VENTNOR HOLD EM FOR A WHILE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0020 WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
3486-166424-0022 A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD

3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0026 IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0029 WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0032 YET IT WAS NOT HER HEIGHT THAT SENT THROUGH ME THE THRILL OF AWE OF HALF INCREDULOUS TERROR WHICH RELAXING MY GRIP LET MY SMOKING RIFLE DROP TO EARTH NOR WAS IT THAT ABOUT HER PROUD HEAD A CLOUD OF SHINING TRESSES SWIRLED AND PENNONED
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0035 AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0041 HESITATINGLY AS YET BUT I KNEW THAT SOON THAT HESITATION WOULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON US ENGULF US TO THE CREVICE I SHOUTED TO DRAKE HE PAID NO HEED TO ME NOR DID RUTH
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0047 UP FROM THEM THRUST A THICK RECTANGULAR COLUMN
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0050 A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0053 PREENING TESTING ITSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0056 BECAME A HUNDRED FOOT CHAIN WHICH SWIRLED LIKE A FLAIL THROUGH THE HUDDLING MASS DOWN UPON A KNOT OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD BLOW DROVE A THIRD ARM DRIVING THROUGH THEM LIKE A GIANT PUNCH
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0059 THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0062 WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0065 WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0068 THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0071 IT THREW THEM BROKEN AND TORN FAR TOWARD THE VALLEY'S SLOPING SIDES IT LEFT ONLY FRAGMENTS THAT BORE NO SEMBLANCE TO MEN VENTNOR WAS AT CHIU MING'S HEAD I DROPPED BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A CRIMSON FROTH UPON HIS LIPS
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0074 HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH A SCORE OF FIGURES CREPT ALL THAT WERE LEFT OF THOSE WHO BUT A LITTLE BEFORE HAD STREAMED DOWN TO TAKE US CAPTIVE OR TO SLAY
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
