3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
