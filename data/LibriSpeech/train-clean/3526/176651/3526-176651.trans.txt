3526-176651-0000 AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
3526-176651-0001 AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
3526-176651-0002 THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
3526-176651-0003 AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
3526-176651-0004 SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
3526-176651-0005 SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
3526-176651-0006 IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0008 AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
3526-176651-0009 MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
3526-176651-0010 THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
3526-176651-0011 SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
3526-176651-0012 WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
3526-176651-0013 THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
3526-176651-0014 WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
3526-176651-0015 LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
3526-176651-0016 AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
3526-176651-0017 NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
3526-176651-0018 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
3526-176651-0019 WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
3526-176651-0020 IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
3526-176651-0021 SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3526-176651-0022 SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
