3664-11714-0000 HE HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT THE DRAUGHTS CONTAINING DISSOLVED PEARLS WHICH THE QUACK DOCTOR LEONI DI SPOLETO PRESCRIBED FOR HIM AS IF HE DESIRED TO ADAPT HIS REMEDIES RATHER TO THE RICHES OF HIS PATIENT THAN TO HIS NECESSITIES
3664-11714-0001 WERE USELESS AND UNAVAILING AND SO HE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST PART FROM THOSE GENTLE TONGUED WOMEN OF HIS THOSE SWEET VOICED POETS HIS PALACES AND THEIR RICH HANGINGS THEREFORE HE HAD SUMMONED TO GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION FOR HIS SINS
3664-11714-0002 IN A MAN OF LESS HIGH PLACE THEY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN CALLED CRIMES THE DOMINICAN GIRALAMO FRANCESCO SAVONAROLA IT WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT AN INWARD FEAR AGAINST WHICH THE PRAISES OF HIS FRIENDS AVAILED NOTHING
3664-11714-0003 THAT THE PLEASURE SEEKER AND USURPER AWAITED THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY PREACHER BY WHOSE WORDS ALL FLORENCE WAS STIRRED AND ON WHOSE PARDON HENCEFORTH DEPENDED ALL HIS HOPE FOR ANOTHER WORLD INDEED SAVONAROLA WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN OF STONE
3664-11714-0004 COMING LIKE THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDANTE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF A DON GIOVANNI AND IN THE MIDST OF FEAST AND ORGY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS EVEN NOW THE MOMENT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF HEAVEN HE HAD BEEN BORN AT FERRARA
3664-11714-0005 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0006 A DEFECTIVE PRONUNCIATION AND ABOVE ALL THE DEPRESSION OF HIS PHYSICAL POWERS EXHAUSTED AS THEY WERE BY TOO SEVERE ABSTINENCE SAVONAROLA FROM THAT TIME CONDEMNED HIMSELF TO THE MOST ABSOLUTE SECLUSION AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS CONVENT
3664-11714-0007 AS IF THE SLAB OF HIS TOMB HAD ALREADY FALLEN OVER HIM THERE KNEELING ON THE FLAGS PRAYING UNCEASINGLY BEFORE A WOODEN CRUCIFIX FEVERED BY VIGILS AND PENANCES HE SOON PASSED OUT OF CONTEMPLATION INTO ECSTASY AND BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIMSELF
3664-11714-0008 THAT INWARD PROPHETIC IMPULSE WHICH SUMMONED HIM TO PREACH THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH NEVERTHELESS THE REFORMATION OF SAVONAROLA MORE REVERENTIAL THAN LUTHER'S WHICH FOLLOWED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS LATER RESPECTED THE THING WHILE ATTACKING THE MAN
3664-11714-0009 AND HAD AS ITS AIM THE ALTERING OF TEACHING THAT WAS HUMAN NOT FAITH THAT WAS OF GOD HE DID NOT WORK LIKE THE GERMAN MONK BY REASONING BUT BY ENTHUSIASM WITH HIM LOGIC ALWAYS GAVE WAY BEFORE INSPIRATION HE WAS NOT A THEOLOGIAN
3664-11714-0010 BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
3664-11714-0011 THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT SO LONG AS LORENZO LIVED IN RICHES HAPPINESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SAVONAROLA HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING WHATEVER ENTREATIES WERE MADE TO SANCTION BY HIS PRESENCE A POWER WHICH HE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE
3664-11714-0012 BUT LORENZO ON HIS DEATHBED SENT FOR HIM AND THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER THE AUSTERE PREACHER SET FORTH AT ONCE BAREHEADED AND BAREFOOT HOPING TO SAVE NOT ONLY THE SOUL OF THE DYING MAN BUT ALSO THE LIBERTY OF THE REPUBLIC
3664-11714-0013 LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
3664-11714-0014 APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD WHEN HE PERCEIVED HIM LORENZO DEI MEDICI READING IN HIS MARBLE BROW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF A STATUE FELL BACK ON HIS BED BREATHING A SIGH SO PROFOUND THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED IT WAS HIS LAST
3664-11714-0015 THEN HE ADVANCED WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN STEP TOWARDS THE BED LORENZO WATCHED HIS APPROACH WITH TERROR THEN WHEN HE WAS CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE CRIED O MY FATHER I HAVE BEEN A VERY GREAT SINNER THE MERCY OF GOD IS INFINITE REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0016 YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE MY SINS CRIED THE DYING MAN RENEWING HIS HOPE AS HE HEARD FROM THE LIPS OF THE MONK SUCH UNEXPECTED WORDS YOUR SINS AND ALSO YOUR CRIMES GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM ALL REPLIED SAVONAROLA
3664-11714-0017 GOD WILL FORGIVE YOUR VANITIES YOUR ADULTEROUS PLEASURES YOUR OBSCENE FESTIVALS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SINS
3664-11714-0018 FRANCESCO FRESCOBALDI AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OTHERS WHOSE NAMES WERE NONE THE LESS DEAR TO FLORENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS RENOWNED SO MUCH FOR YOUR CRIMES AND AT EACH OF THESE NAMES WHICH SAVONAROLA PRONOUNCED SLOWLY HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DYING MAN
3664-11714-0019 HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
3664-11714-0020 EVERYTHING SAID SAVONAROLA BUT ON THREE CONDITIONS WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE DYING MAN THE FIRST SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU FEEL A COMPLETE FAITH IN THE POWER AND THE MERCY OF GOD
3664-11714-0021 MY FATHER REPLIED LORENZO EAGERLY I FEEL THIS FAITH IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF MY HEART THE SECOND SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU GIVE BACK THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS WHICH YOU HAVE UNJUSTLY CONFISCATED AND KEPT
3664-11714-0022 MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0023 EXCLAIMED LORENZO FALLING BACK ON HIS BED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD NEVER THE MONK WITHOUT REPLYING A SINGLE WORD MADE A STEP TO WITHDRAW MY FATHER MY FATHER SAID THE DYING MAN DO NOT LEAVE ME THUS HAVE PITY ON ME HAVE PITY ON FLORENCE SAID THE MONK
3664-11714-0024 BUT MY FATHER CRIED LORENZO FLORENCE IS FREE FLORENCE IS HAPPY FLORENCE IS A SLAVE FLORENCE IS POOR CRIED SAVONAROLA POOR IN GENIUS POOR IN MONEY AND POOR IN COURAGE POOR IN GENIUS BECAUSE AFTER YOU LORENZO
3664-11714-0025 WILL COME YOUR SON PIERO POOR IN MONEY BECAUSE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE REPUBLIC YOU HAVE KEPT UP THE MAGNIFICENCE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE CREDIT OF YOUR BUSINESS HOUSES POOR IN COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ROBBED THE RIGHTFUL MAGISTRATES OF THE AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY THEIRS
3664-11714-0026 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-11714-0027 IT IS NOT I WHO DESIRE IT IT IS THE LORD REPLIED SAVONAROLA COLDLY IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE MURMURED LORENZO VERY WELL THEN DIE AS YOU HAVE LIVED CRIED THE MONK IN THE MIDST OF YOUR COURTIERS AND FLATTERERS
3664-11714-0028 LET THEM RUIN YOUR SOUL AS THEY HAVE RUINED YOUR BODY AND AT THESE WORDS THE AUSTERE DOMINICAN WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE CRIES OF THE DYING MAN LEFT THE ROOM AS HE HAD ENTERED IT WITH FACE AND STEP UNALTERED FAR ABOVE HUMAN THINGS HE SEEMED TO SOAR
3664-11714-0029 A SPIRIT ALREADY DETACHED FROM THE EARTH AT THE CRY WHICH BROKE FROM LORENZO DEI MEDICI WHEN HE SAW HIM DISAPPEAR
3664-11714-0030 AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
3664-11714-0031 HIS LIPS CLINGING TO THE FEET OF THE CHRIST HE BREATHED HIS LAST IN THE ARMS OF THESE THREE MEN OF WHOM THE MOST FORTUNATE THOUGH ALL THREE WERE YOUNG WAS NOT DESTINED TO SURVIVE HIM MORE THAN TWO YEARS
