3664-178366-0002 AND IF I WANTED A COMMISSION ONE COULD EASILY BE PROCURED FOR ME I THANKED GENERAL ORD FOR HIS KINDNESS AND SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY WAS A TEMPTING PRIZE YET I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION I WAS THEN HOLDING

3664-178366-0005 BUT HAD SENT WORD THAT I WAS TO BE HIS AND THE COLONEL'S GUEST AT THEIR HOUSE WHILE I REMAINED IN CHICAGO I SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS VERY PLEASANTLY IN THE GREAT CITY OF THE WEST MEETING SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SHERIDAN HUNT IN SEPTEMBER GENERAL STAGER

3664-178366-0007 THAT IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FACE THE THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES
3664-178366-0008 I WAS TO STOP AT NIAGARA FALLS BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK AND HE PROVIDED ME WITH ALL THE NECESSARY RAILROAD PASSES JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE CHICAGO I MET PROFESSOR HENRY A WARD OF ROCHESTER FOR WHOM DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR TWO
3664-178366-0009 I HAD COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS OF WILD ANIMALS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO ROCHESTER AND KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO ACT AS MY GUIDE UNTIL WE REACHED THAT POINT WE SPENT ONE DAY IN VIEWING THE WONDERS OF NIAGARA
3664-178366-0010 AND I HAD THE HONOR OF RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT NEW YORK I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY MISTER J G HECKSHER WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMITTEE OF ONE TO ESCORT ME TO THE UNION CLUB
3664-178366-0011 WHERE JAMES GORDON BENNETT LEONARD W JEROME AND OTHERS WERE TO GIVE ME AN INFORMAL RECEPTION AND WHERE I WAS TO MAKE MY HEADQUARTERS DURING MY VISIT IN THE GREAT METROPOLIS I HAD AN ELEGANT DINNER AT THE CLUB ROOMS WITH THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SEPTEMBER HUNT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
3664-178366-0012 HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME AND INSISTED ON MY BECOMING HIS GUEST HE WOULD LISTEN TO NO EXCUSES AND ON INTRODUCING ME TO MESSRS OVERTON AND BLAIR PROPRIETORS OF THE BREVOORT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A PRESSING INVITATION TO MAKE MY HOME AT THEIR HOUSE
3664-178366-0013 I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
3664-178366-0014 CONVINCING ME THAT AS YET I HAD SEEN BUT A SMALL PORTION OF THE WORLD I RECEIVED NUMEROUS DINNER INVITATIONS AS WELL AS INVITATIONS TO VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND INTEREST BUT AS THEY CAME IN SO THICK AND FAST I SOON BECAME BADLY DEMORALIZED AND CONFUSED
3664-178366-0015 I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
3664-178366-0016 BUT OWING TO MY CONFUSION ARISING FROM THE MANY OTHER INVITATIONS I HAD RECEIVED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT AND DINED ELSEWHERE THIS WAS A BAD BREAK BUT I DID NOT LEARN OF MY MISTAKE UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN AT THE UNION CLUB HOUSE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM LAWRENCE JEROME
3664-178366-0017 AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
3664-178366-0018 I APOLOGIZED AS WELL AS I COULD BY SAYING THAT I HAD BEEN OUT ON A SCOUT AND HAD GOT LOST AND HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE DINNER AND EXPRESSED MY REGRET FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD CREATED BY MY FORGETFULNESS AUGUST BELMONT THE BANKER BEING NEAR SAID
3664-178366-0019 NEVER MIND GENTLEMEN I'LL GIVE CODY A DINNER AT MY HOUSE THANK YOU SIR SAID I I SEE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT I SHALL NOT RUN SHORT OF RATIONS WHILE I AM IN THE CITY I'LL BE THERE SURE
3664-178366-0020 BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
3664-178366-0021 MISTER BENNETT WHO WAS AMONG THE GUESTS HAVING FORGIVEN MY CARELESSNESS INVITED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LIEDERKRANZ MASKED BALL WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW EVENINGS AND WOULD BE A GRAND SPECTACLE TOGETHER WE ATTENDED THE BALL AND DURING THE EVENING I WAS WELL ENTERTAINED
3664-178366-0022 THE DANCERS KEPT ON THEIR MASKS UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THE MERRY AND MOTLEY THRONG PRESENTED A BRILLIANT SCENE MOVING GRACEFULLY BENEATH THE BRIGHT GAS LIGHT TO THE INSPIRITING MUSIC TO ME IT WAS A NOVEL AND ENTERTAINING SIGHT
3664-178366-0023 AND EXHIBITED SOME OF MY BACKWOODS STEPS WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT AS GRACEFUL AS SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL MORE EMPHATIC BUT WHEN I UNDERTOOK TO DO ARTISTIC DANCING I FOUND I WAS DECIDEDLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT CROWD AND I ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW FROM THE FLOOR
3664-178366-0024 I OCCASIONALLY PASSED AN EVENING AT NIBLO'S GARDEN VIEWING THE MANY BEAUTIES OF THE BLACK CROOK WHICH WAS THEN HAVING ITS LONG RUN UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF JARRETT AND PALMER WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I HAD MADE AND WHO EXTENDED TO ME THE FREEDOM OF THE THEATER
3664-178366-0025 NED BUNTLINE AND FRED MAEDER HAD DRAMATIZED ONE OF THE STORIES WHICH THE FORMER HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR THE NEW YORK WEEKLY THE DRAMA WAS CALLED BUFFALO BILL THE KING OF BORDER MEN WHILE I WAS IN NEW YORK IT WAS PRODUCED AT THE BOWERY THEATER
3664-178366-0026 AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0027 THE AUDIENCE UPON LEARNING THAT THE REAL BUFFALO BILL WAS PRESENT GAVE SEVERAL CHEERS BETWEEN THE ACTS AND I WAS CALLED ON TO COME OUT ON THE STAGE AND MAKE A SPEECH
3664-178366-0028 AND THAT I SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER STUDLEY I FINALLY CONSENTED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF STANDING BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS AND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I LOOKED UP THEN DOWN THEN ON EACH SIDE AND EVERYWHERE I SAW A SEA OF HUMAN FACES
3664-178366-0029 BUT WHAT THEY WERE I COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME TELL NOR COULD ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE MY UTTERANCES WERE INAUDIBLE EVEN TO THE LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA MISTER DEAN WHO WAS SITTING ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF ME BOWING TO THE AUDIENCE I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO ONE OF THE CANONS OF THE STAGE
3664-178366-0030 I NEVER FELT MORE RELIEVED IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE VIEW OF THAT IMMENSE CROWD THAT EVENING MISTER FRELEIGH OFFERED TO GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO PLAY THE PART OF BUFFALO BILL MYSELF
3664-178366-0031 AND THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO MAKE AN ACTOR OUT OF A GOVERNMENT MULE I THANKED HIM FOR THE GENEROUS OFFER WHICH I HAD TO DECLINE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF OR AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EXPRESS IT I DIDN'T HAVE THE REQUISITE CHEEK TO UNDERTAKE A THING OF THAT SORT
3664-178366-0032 THE PLAY OF BUFFALO BILL HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL RUN OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AND WAS AFTERWARDS PRODUCED IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE BEING RECEIVED WITH GENUINE ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0033 I MET HIM SOON AFTER HE GOT INTO TOWN IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION HOW I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF I REPLIED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE BEST CAMP I HAD EVER SEEN AND IF HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ABOUT TEN DAYS
3664-178366-0034 THIS HE WILLINGLY DID AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SERVICES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED AT FORT MC PHERSON AS THERE WAS TO BE AN EXPEDITION SENT OUT FROM THAT POINT AT WESTCHESTER PENNSYLVANIA I HAD SOME RELATIVES LIVING WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
3664-178366-0035 AND NOW BEING SO NEAR I DETERMINED TO MAKE THEM A VISIT UPON MENTIONING THE MATTER TO BUNTLINE HE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TOGETHER TAKE A TRIP TO PHILADELPHIA AND THENCE RUN OUT TO WESTCHESTER
3664-178366-0036 AMONG THEM AN ELDERLY LADY WHO WAS MY GRANDMOTHER AS HE INFORMED ME HE TOLD ME THAT MY AUNT ELIZA HIS FIRST WIFE WAS DEAD AND THAT HE HAD MARRIED A SECOND TIME LIZZIE GUSS MY COUSIN I THOUGHT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I HAD EVER SEEN
3664-178366-0037 THEY WERE ALL VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE US REMAIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT AS I HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO IN NEW YORK I WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN THAT DAY ASSURING THEM HOWEVER THAT I WOULD VISIT THEM AGAIN SOON I BADE THEM ADIEU AND WITH BUNTLINE TOOK THE TRAIN FOR NEW YORK
