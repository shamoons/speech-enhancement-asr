3699-175950-0000 S'DEATH CRIED MY GREAT GRANDFATHER CLAPPING HIS HAND UPON HIS NOSE
3699-175950-0001 NOW MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S NOSE WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE UNTO THE NOSES OF ALL THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM PANTAGRUEL FOUND DWELLING UPON THE ISLAND OF ENNASIN
3699-175950-0002 BY THE WAY IF YOU WOULD KNOW THE STRANGE WAY OF GETTING A KIN AMONGST SO FLAT NOSED A PEOPLE YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIND IT OUT YOURSELF YOU NEVER CAN
3699-175950-0003 YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
3699-175950-0004 SO THAT MY FATHER HAD THE JOINTURE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS HALF YEARLY ON MICHAELMAS AND LADY DAY DURING ALL THAT TIME NO MAN DISCHARGED PECUNIARY OBLIGATIONS WITH A BETTER GRACE THAN MY FATHER
3699-175950-0005 AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTER'D UPON THE ODD FIFTY HE GENERALLY GAVE A LOUD HEM
3699-175950-0006 INSERTED HIS HAND CAUTIOUSLY BETWIXT HIS HEAD AND THE CAWL OF HIS WIG LOOK'D AT BOTH SIDES OF EVERY GUINEA AS HE PARTED WITH IT AND SELDOM COULD GET TO THE END OF THE FIFTY POUNDS WITHOUT PULLING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPING HIS TEMPLES
3699-175950-0007 AND FEEL PITY FOR THE FORCE OF EDUCATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF OPINIONS LONG DERIVED FROM ANCESTORS FOR THREE GENERATIONS AT LEAST THIS TENET IN FAVOUR OF LONG NOSES
3699-175950-0008 SO THAT THE WHIMSICALITY OF MY FATHER'S BRAIN WAS FAR FROM HAVING THE WHOLE HONOUR OF THIS AS IT HAD OF ALMOST ALL HIS OTHER STRANGE NOTIONS FOR IN A GREAT MEASURE HE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SUCK'D THIS IN WITH HIS MOTHER'S MILK
3699-175950-0009 THAT HE DID NOT CONCEIVE HOW THE GREATEST FAMILY IN ENGLAND COULD STAND IT OUT AGAINST AN UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION OF SIX OR SEVEN SHORT NOSES AND FOR THE CONTRARY REASON HE WOULD GENERALLY ADD
3699-175950-0010 THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
3699-175950-0011 I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
3699-175950-0012 DID HE READ SUCH BOOKS AND OBSERVE SUCH FACTS AND THINK SUCH THOUGHTS AS WOULD ETERNALLY BE MAKING HIM CHANGE SIDES NOW MY FATHER AS I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR DETESTED ALL THIS HE PICK'D UP AN OPINION SIR
3699-175950-0013 AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
3699-175950-0014 THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
3699-175950-0015 OR WHEN HE CHEW'D IT OR WHEN HE ROASTED IT OR WHEN HE PEEL'D OR WHEN HE BROUGHT IT HOME OR WHEN HE DIGESTED OR WHEN HE FOR TIS PLAIN SIR IF THE FIRST PICKING UP OF THE APPLE MADE IT NOT HIS THAT NO SUBSEQUENT ACT COULD
3699-175950-0016 BROTHER DIDIUS TRIBONIUS WILL ANSWER NOW TRIBONIUS THE CIVILIAN AND CHURCH LAWYER'S BEARD BEING THREE INCHES AND A HALF AND THREE EIGHTHS LONGER THAN DIDIUS HIS BEARD
3699-175950-0017 THAT THE SWEAT OF A MAN'S BROWS AND THE EXSUDATIONS OF A MAN'S BRAINS ARE AS MUCH A MAN'S OWN PROPERTY AS THE BREECHES UPON HIS BACKSIDE
3699-175950-0018 THEY HAD COST HIM MOREOVER AS MUCH LABOUR IN COOKING AND DIGESTING AS IN THE CASE ABOVE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WELL AND TRULY BE SAID TO BE OF HIS OWN GOODS AND CHATTELS ACCORDINGLY HE HELD FAST BY EM BOTH BY TEETH AND CLAWS
3699-175950-0019 WOULD FLY TO WHATEVER HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AND IN A WORD WOULD INTRENCH AND FORTIFY THEM ROUND WITH AS MANY CIRCUMVALLATIONS AND BREAST WORKS AS MY UNCLE TOBY WOULD A CITADEL
3699-175950-0020 BY THE TROTTING OF MY LEAN HORSE THE THING IS INCREDIBLE AND I AM QUITE LOST IN MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I AM CONSIDERING WHAT A TREASURE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND TALENTS TOGETHER HAS BEEN WASTED UPON WORSE SUBJECTS
3699-175950-0021 WHAT WAS TO BE HAD HOWEVER HE SET THE GREATER STORE BY AND THOUGH MY FATHER WOULD OFT TIMES SPORT WITH MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIBRARY WHICH BY THE BYE WAS RIDICULOUS ENOUGH
3699-175950-0022 BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
3699-175950-0023 WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
3699-175950-0024 DEVOUREDST NO MAN'S BREAD GENTLY WITH FAITHFUL TRIM BEHIND THEE DIDST THOU AMBLE ROUND THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF THY PLEASURES JOSTLING NO CREATURE IN THY WAY FOR EACH ONE'S SORROWS THOU HADST A TEAR
3699-175950-0025 FOR EACH MAN'S NEED THOU HADST A SHILLING WHILST I AM WORTH ONE TO PAY A WEEDER THY PATH FROM THY DOOR TO THY BOWLING GREEN SHALL NEVER BE GROWN UP
