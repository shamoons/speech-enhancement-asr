3699-47246-0000 CHAPTER FOUR I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MILBY HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AS BAD AS THEY IMAGINED
3699-47246-0001 NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
3699-47246-0002 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0003 AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
3699-47246-0004 HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
3699-47246-0005 INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
3699-47246-0006 MISS PHIPPS FOR HER PART DIDN'T LIKE DRESSING FOR EFFECT SHE HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT STYLE OF APPEARANCE WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO CREATE A SENSATION
3699-47246-0007 THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
3699-47246-0008 HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
3699-47246-0009 HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
3699-47246-0010 MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
3699-47246-0011 EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
3699-47246-0012 OF THE SMALLEST DESCRIPTION INDEED HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO CALL IT HIS OWN HE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY RECALCITRANT NOW AND THEN AS IS THE HABIT OF LONG EARED PACHYDERMS UNDER THE THONG OF THE FAIR COUNTESS'S TONGUE
3699-47246-0013 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
3699-47246-0014 AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
3699-47246-0015 WHOM HE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE PAS DE BAS AND THE LANCERS QUADRILLES SHE HAD HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY MATRIMONY WITH CZERLASKI WHO HAD TAKEN HER TO PARIS AND GERMANY
3699-47246-0016 NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
3699-47246-0017 ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
3699-47246-0018 WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
3699-47246-0019 SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
3699-47246-0020 AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
3699-47246-0021 THERE WAS NOTHING HERE SO VERY DETESTABLE IT IS TRUE THE COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE VAIN A LITTLE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE SELFISH A LITTLE SHALLOW AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE GIVEN TO WHITE LIES BUT
3699-47246-0022 WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
3699-47246-0023 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0024 WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
3699-47246-0025 IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
3699-47246-0026 SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
3699-47246-0027 AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
3699-47246-0028 AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
3699-47246-0029 THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
3699-47246-0030 FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
3699-47246-0031 THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
3699-47246-0032 STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
