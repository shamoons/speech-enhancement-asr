374-180299-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
374-180299-0001 IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE

374-180299-0003 WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
374-180299-0004 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
374-180299-0005 NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
374-180299-0006 I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
374-180299-0007 HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
374-180299-0008 AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
374-180299-0009 AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
374-180299-0010 A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
374-180299-0011 PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
374-180299-0012 ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
374-180299-0013 AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
374-180299-0014 HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
374-180299-0015 AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
374-180299-0016 MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
374-180299-0017 AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
374-180299-0018 SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
374-180299-0019 FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
374-180299-0020 AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
374-180299-0021 AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0022 THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
374-180299-0023 WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
374-180299-0024 AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
374-180299-0025 AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
374-180299-0026 AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
374-180299-0027 WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
374-180299-0028 AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
374-180299-0029 I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
374-180299-0030 COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
374-180299-0031 NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
374-180299-0032 AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
374-180299-0033 SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
374-180299-0034 MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
374-180299-0035 ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
374-180299-0036 WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
374-180299-0037 FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
374-180299-0038 I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
374-180299-0039 WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
374-180299-0040 AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
374-180299-0041 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
374-180299-0042 THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0043 HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
374-180299-0044 AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
374-180299-0045 THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
374-180299-0046 I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
