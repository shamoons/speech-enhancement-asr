3807-4923-0006 HIS NAUTICAL FANCY PICTURED THE OSPREY HELPLESSLY ROLLING ON THE SWELL OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN OR HOPELESSLY LOCKED IN THE ICE OF THE ANTARCTIC SEAS AND HE DIMLY GUESSED AT THE FATE OF THE DELUDED TEN
3807-4923-0007 EVEN IF THEY GOT SAFE TO PORT THE CHANCES OF FINAL ESCAPE WERE ALL AGAINST THEM FOR WHAT ACCOUNT COULD THEY GIVE OF THEMSELVES OVERPOWERED BY THESE REFLECTIONS THE HONEST FELLOW MADE ONE LAST EFFORT TO CHARM HIS CAPTORS BACK TO THEIR PRISTINE BONDAGE
3807-4923-0008 FOOLS HE CRIED DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE GIVE UP THE BRIG AND I WILL DECLARE BEFORE MY GOD UPON THE BIBLE THAT I WILL SAY NOTHING BUT GIVE ALL GOOD CHARACTERS
3807-4923-0009 LESLY AND ANOTHER BURST INTO A LAUGH AT THIS WILD PROPOSITION BUT REX WHO HAD WEIGHED HIS CHANCES WELL BEFOREHAND FELT THE FORCE OF THE PILOT'S SPEECH AND ANSWERED SERIOUSLY IT'S NO USE TALKING HE SAID SHAKING HIS STILL HANDSOME HEAD

3807-4923-0015 FRIGHTENED LET ME PASS PRISONER THE WHOLE DECK BURST INTO A GREAT LAUGH AT THIS AND POOR MISSUS VICKERS PAUSED TREMBLING FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHILD'S TEMERITY TO THUS TAUNT THE DESPERATE CONVICT WHO HELD THEIR LIVES IN HIS HANDS SEEMED SHEER MADNESS
3807-4923-0016 IN THE BOLDNESS OF THE SPEECH HOWEVER LAY ITS SAFEGUARD REX WHOSE POLITENESS WAS MERE BRAVADO WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE REFLECTION UPON HIS COURAGE AND THE BITTER ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD PRISONER
3807-4923-0017 THE GENERIC NAME OF CONVICTS MADE HIM BITE HIS LIPS WITH RAGE HAD HE HAD HIS WILL HE WOULD HAVE STRUCK THE LITTLE CREATURE TO THE DECK BUT THE HOARSE LAUGH OF HIS COMPANIONS WARNED HIM TO FORBEAR THERE IS PUBLIC OPINION EVEN AMONG CONVICTS
3807-4923-0018 AND REX DARED NOT VENT HIS PASSION ON SO HELPLESS AN OBJECT AS MEN DO IN SUCH CASES HE VEILED HIS ANGER BENEATH AN AFFECTATION OF AMUSEMENT IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT MOVED BY THE TAUNT HE SMILED UPON THE TAUNTER MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN EVER
3807-4923-0019 YOUR DAUGHTER HAS HER FATHER'S SPIRIT MADAM SAID HE TO MISSUS VICKERS WITH A BOW BATES OPENED HIS MOUTH TO LISTEN HIS EARS WERE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE IN THE WORDS OF THIS COMPLIMENTARY CONVICT HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A NIGHTMARE HE ABSOLUTELY FELT
3807-4923-0020 THAT JOHN REX WAS A GREATER MAN AT THAT MOMENT THAN JOHN BATES AS MISSUS VICKERS DESCENDED THE HATCHWAY THE BOAT WITH FRERE AND THE SOLDIERS CAME WITHIN MUSKET RANGE AND LESLY ACCORDING TO ORDERS FIRED HIS MUSKET OVER THEIR HEADS
3807-4923-0021 SHOUTING TO THEM TO LAY TO BUT FRERE BOILING WITH RAGE AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED ON HIM HAD DETERMINED NOT TO RESIGN HIS LOST AUTHORITY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE DISREGARDING THE SUMMONS HE CAME STRAIGHT ON WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE VESSEL
3807-4923-0022 IT WAS NOW NEARLY DARK AND THE FIGURES ON THE DECK WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE THE INDIGNANT LIEUTENANT COULD BUT GUESS AT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS A VOICE HAILED HIM HOLD WATER BACK WATER
3807-4923-0023 IT CRIED AND WAS THEN SEEMINGLY CHOKED IN ITS OWNER'S THROAT THE VOICE WAS THE PROPERTY OF MISTER BATES STANDING NEAR THE SIDE HE HAD OBSERVED REX AND FAIR BRING UP A GREAT PIG OF IRON ERST USED AS PART OF THE BALLAST OF THE BRIG
3807-4923-0024 AND POISE IT ON THE RAIL THEIR INTENTION WAS BUT TOO EVIDENT AND HONEST BATES LIKE A FAITHFUL WATCH DOG BARKED TO WARN HIS MASTER BLOODTHIRSTY CHESHIRE CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT AND FRERE UNHEEDING
3807-4923-0025 RAN THE BOAT ALONGSIDE UNDER THE VERY NOSE OF THE REVENGEFUL REX THE MASS OF IRON FELL HALF IN BOARD UPON THE NOW STAYED BOAT AND GAVE HER STERNWAY WITH A SPLINTERED PLANK VILLAINS CRIED FRERE WOULD YOU SWAMP US
3807-4923-0026 AND A DOZEN SUCH AS YE THE BRIG'S OURS CAN'T YE SEE AND WE'RE YOUR MASTERS NOW FRERE STIFLING AN EXCLAMATION OF RAGE CRIED TO THE BOW TO HOOK ON BUT THE BOW HAD DRIVEN THE BOAT BACKWARD AND SHE WAS ALREADY BEYOND ARM'S LENGTH OF THE BRIG
3807-4923-0027 LOOKING UP HE SAW CHESHIRE'S SAVAGE FACE AND HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LOCK AS HE COCKED HIS PIECE THE TWO SOLDIERS EXHAUSTED BY THEIR LONG PULL MADE NO EFFORT TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE BOAT
3807-4923-0028 THE DECK OF THE OSPREY HAD BECOME INVISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS FRERE STRUCK HIS FIST UPON THE THWART IN SHEER IMPOTENCE OF RAGE THE SCOUNDRELS HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH THEY'VE MASTERED US WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO DO NEXT
3807-4923-0029 THE ANSWER CAME PAT TO THE QUESTION FROM THE DARK HULL OF THE BRIG BROKE A FLASH AND A REPORT AND A MUSKET BALL CUT THE WATER BESIDE THEM WITH A CHIRPING NOISE BETWEEN THE BLACK INDISTINCT MASS WHICH REPRESENTED THE BRIG
3807-4923-0030 AND THE GLIMMERING WATER WAS VISIBLE A WHITE SPECK WHICH GRADUALLY NEARED THEM COME ALONGSIDE WITH YE HAILED A VOICE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YE THEY WANT TO MURDER US SAYS FRERE GIVE WAY MEN
3807-4923-0031 IT'S NO USE MISTER FRERE SAID THE MAN NEAREST HIM WE CAN DO NO GOOD NOW AND THEY WON'T HURT US I DARE SAY YOU DOGS YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEM BURSTS OUT FRERE PURPLE WITH INDIGNATION DO YOU MUTINY
3807-4923-0032 COME COME SIR RETURNED THE SOLDIER SULKILY THIS AIN'T THE TIME TO BULLY AND AS FOR MUTINY WHY ONE MAN'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER JUST NOW THIS SPEECH FROM THE LIPS OF A MAN WHO
3807-4923-0033 BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WOULD HAVE RISKED HIS LIFE TO OBEY ORDERS OF HIS OFFICER DID MORE THAN AN HOUR'S REASONING TO CONVINCE MAURICE FRERE OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF RESISTANCE HIS AUTHORITY
3807-4923-0034 HE WAS NOW NO MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE INDEED HE WAS LESS THAN MANY FOR THOSE WHO HELD THE FIREARMS WERE THE RULING POWERS WITH A GROAN HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AND LOOKING AT THE SLEEVE OF THE UNDRESS UNIFORM HE WORE
3807-4923-0035 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT VIRTUE HAD GONE OUT OF IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE BRIG THEY FOUND THAT THE JOLLY BOAT HAD BEEN LOWERED AND LAID ALONGSIDE IN HER WERE ELEVEN PERSONS BATES WITH FOREHEAD GASHED AND HANDS BOUND THE STUNNED GRIMES
3807-4923-0036 RUSSEN AND FAIR PULLING LYON RILEY CHESHIRE AND LESLY WITH MUSKETS AND JOHN REX IN THE STERN SHEETS
3807-4923-0037 AND A LOADED MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE MEN IN THE WHALE BOAT WAS A LARGE WHITE SHAWL WHICH WRAPPED MISSUS VICKERS AND SYLVIA
3807-4923-0038 HE HAD FEARED THAT THE CHILD WAS INJURED BY THE DIRECTION OF REX THE WHALE BOAT WAS BROUGHT ALONGSIDE THE JOLLY BOAT AND CHESHIRE AND LESLY BOARDED HER
3807-4923-0039 FRERE ATTEMPTED TO RESIST THIS INDIGNITY BUT CHESHIRE CLAPPING HIS MUSKET TO HIS EAR SWORE HE WOULD BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE UTTERED ANOTHER SYLLABLE FRERE CATCHING THE MALIGNANT EYE OF JOHN REX
3807-4923-0040 REMEMBERED HOW EASILY A TWITCH OF THE FINGER WOULD PAY OFF OLD SCORES AND WAS SILENT STEP IN HERE SIR IF YOU PLEASE SAID REX WITH POLITE IRONY I AM SORRY TO BE COMPELLED TO TIE YOU BUT I MUST CONSULT MY OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS YOUR CONVENIENCE
3807-4923-0041 FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
3807-4923-0042 POOR MISSUS VICKERS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INSTINCT SAW THIS AND EVEN AMID HER OWN TROUBLE FOUND LEISURE TO CONSOLE HIM THE WRETCHES SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH AS FRERE WAS FLUNG DOWN BESIDE HER TO SUBJECT YOU TO SUCH INDIGNITY
3807-4923-0043 SYLVIA SAID NOTHING AND SEEMED TO SHRINK FROM THE LIEUTENANT PERHAPS IN HER CHILDISH FANCY SHE HAD PICTURED HIM AS COMING TO HER RESCUE
3807-4923-0044 AND CLAD IN DAZZLING MAIL OR AT THE VERY LEAST AS A MUSCULAR HERO WHO WOULD SETTLE AFFAIRS OUT OF HAND BY SHEER PERSONAL PROWESS IF SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ANY SUCH NOTION THE REALITY MUST HAVE STRUCK COLDLY UPON HER SENSES
3807-4923-0045 MISTER FRERE PURPLE CLUMSY AND BOUND WAS NOT AT ALL HEROIC NOW MY LADS SAYS REX WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ENDURED THE CAST OFF AUTHORITY OF FRERE WE GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE STAY AT HELL'S GATES OR COME WITH US
3807-4923-0046 THE SOLDIERS PAUSED IRRESOLUTE TO JOIN THE MUTINEERS MEANT A CERTAINTY OF HARD WORK WITH A CHANCE OF ULTIMATE HANGING YET TO STAY WITH THE PRISONERS WAS AS FAR AS THEY COULD SEE TO INCUR THE INEVITABLE FATE OF STARVATION ON A BARREN COAST
3807-4923-0047 DIMLY CAUGHT THE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE
3807-4923-0048 GO WITH HIM YE BEGGARS SAID HE AND LEAVE US HONEST MEN OH YE'LL GET A TYING UP FOR THIS THE PHRASE TYING UP BROUGHT WITH IT RECOLLECTION OF THE WORST PORTION OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE THE CAT
3807-4923-0049 AND REVIVED IN THE MINDS OF THE PAIR ALREADY DISPOSED TO BREAK THE YOKE THAT SAT SO HEAVILY UPON THEM A TRAIN OF DISMAL MEMORIES THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER ON A CONVICT STATION WAS AT THAT TIME A HARD ONE HE WAS OFTEN STINTED IN RATIONS
3807-4923-0050 AND OF NECESSITY DEPRIVED OF ALL RATIONAL RECREATION WHILE PUNISHMENT FOR OFFENCES WAS PROMPT AND SEVERE THE COMPANIES DRAFTED TO THE PENAL SETTLEMENTS WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND THE PAIR HAD GOOD PRECEDENT FOR THE COURSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
3807-4923-0051 WHICH IS IT TO BE WE'LL GO WITH YOU SAYS THE MAN WHO HAD PULLED THE STROKE IN THE WHALE BOAT SPITTING INTO THE WATER WITH AVERTED FACE UPON WHICH UTTERANCE THE CONVICTS BURST INTO JOYOUS OATHS AND THE PAIR WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH HAND SHAKING
3807-4923-0052 THEN REX WITH LYON AND RILEY AS A GUARD GOT INTO THE WHALE BOAT AND HAVING LOOSED THE TWO PRISONERS FROM THEIR BONDS ORDERED THEM TO TAKE THE PLACE OF RUSSEN AND FAIR THE WHALE BOAT WAS MANNED BY THE SEVEN MUTINEERS
3807-4923-0053 REX STEERING FAIR RUSSEN AND THE TWO RECRUITS PULLING AND THE OTHER FOUR STANDING UP WITH THEIR MUSKETS LEVELLED AT THE JOLLY BOAT THEIR LONG SLAVERY HAD BEGOTTEN SUCH A DREAD OF AUTHORITY IN THESE MEN THAT THEY FEARED IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS BOUND AND MENACED BY FOUR MUSKETS
3807-4923-0054 KEEP YOUR DISTANCE SHOUTED CHESHIRE AS FRERE AND BATES IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS BEGAN TO PULL THE JOLLY BOAT TOWARDS THE SHORE AND IN THIS FASHION WAS THE DISMAL LITTLE PARTY CONVEYED TO THE MAINLAND IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED IT
3807-4923-0055 BUT THE CLEAR SKY BEGAN TO THRILL WITH A LATE MOON AS YET UNRISEN AND THE WAVES BREAKING GENTLY UPON THE BEACH GLIMMERED WITH A RADIANCE BORN OF THEIR OWN MOTION FRERE AND BATES JUMPING ASHORE HELPED OUT MISSUS VICKERS SYLVIA AND THE WOUNDED GRIMES
3807-4923-0056 THIS BEING DONE UNDER THE MUZZLES OF THE MUSKETS REX COMMANDED THAT BATES AND FRERE SHOULD PUSH THE JOLLY BOAT AS FAR AS THEY COULD FROM THE SHORE AND RILEY CATCHING HER BY A BOAT HOOK AS SHE CAME TOWARDS THEM SHE WAS TAKEN IN TOW
3807-4923-0057 THREE CHEERS FOR OLD ENGLAND AND LIBERTY UPON WHICH A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP ECHOED BY THE GRIM HILLS WHICH HAD WITNESSED SO MANY MISERIES TO THE WRETCHED FIVE THIS EXULTANT MIRTH SOUNDED LIKE A KNELL OF DEATH
3807-4923-0058 GREAT GOD CRIED BATES RUNNING UP TO HIS KNEES IN WATER AFTER THE DEPARTING BOATS WOULD YOU LEAVE US HERE TO STARVE
