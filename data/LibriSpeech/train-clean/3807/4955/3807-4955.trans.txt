3807-4955-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FLIGHT GABBETT GUIDED BY THE CROW HAD DETERMINED TO BEACH THE CAPTURED BOAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CAPE SURVILLE IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF COLONEL ARTHUR'S PENITENTIARY
3807-4955-0001 THAT NOTHING BUT THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED SO DESPERATE A MEASURE THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS SEEMED TO RENDER SUCH AN ATTEMPT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BUT VETCH WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PIER AT THE NECK
3807-4955-0002 KNEW THAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE PROMONTORY WAS A STRIP OF BEACH UPON WHICH THE COMPANY MIGHT BY GOOD FORTUNE LAND IN SAFETY WITH SOMETHING OF THE DECISION OF HIS LEADER REX THE CROW DETERMINED AT ONCE THAT IN THEIR DESPERATE PLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY MEASURE
3807-4955-0003 AND SETTING HIS TEETH AS HE SEIZED THE OAR THAT SERVED AS A RUDDER HE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THE HUGE ROCK THAT FORMED THE NORTHERN HORN OF PIRATES BAY SAVE FOR THE FAINT PHOSPHORESCENT RADIANCE OF THE FOAMING WAVES THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE
3807-4955-0004 AND BURGESS FOR SOME MINUTES PULLED ALMOST AT RANDOM IN PURSUIT THE SAME TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF MC NAB BY CAUSING REX TO MISS HIS AIM SHOWED TO THE COMMANDANT THE WHALE BOAT BALANCED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE
3807-4955-0005 AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO BE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL OF ROCK WHICH MAGNIFIED IN THE FLASH SEEMED FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THEM THE NEXT INSTANT BURGESS HIMSELF HIS BOAT LIFTED BY THE SWIFTLY ADVANCING BILLOW
3807-4955-0006 SAW A WILD WASTE OF RAGING SEAS SCOOPED INTO ABYSMAL TROUGHS IN WHICH THE BULK OF A LEVIATHAN MIGHT WALLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THESE VALLEYS OF WATER LAY THE MUTINEERS BOAT LOOKING WITH ITS OUTSPREAD OARS LIKE SOME SIX LEGGED INSECT
3807-4955-0007 FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
3807-4955-0008 THE NEXT INSTANT THE RUSHING WATER CARRYING THE SIX LEGGED ATOM WITH IT CREAMED UP OVER THIS STRIP OF BEACH
3807-4955-0009 APPEARED TO STOOP DOWN OVER THE OCEAN AND AS IT STOOPED THE BILLOW ROLLED ONWARDS THE BOAT GLIDED DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS AND THE WHOLE PHANTASMAGORIA WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TUMULTUOUS DARKNESS OF THE TEMPEST BURGESS HIS HAIR BRISTLING WITH TERROR
3807-4955-0010 SHOUTED TO PUT THE BOAT ABOUT BUT HE MIGHT WITH AS MUCH REASON HAVE SHOUTED AT AN AVALANCHE THE WIND BLEW HIS VOICE AWAY AND EMPTIED IT VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR A SNARLING BILLOW JERKED THE OAR FROM HIS HAND
3807-4955-0011 DESPITE THE DESPERATE EFFORTS OF THE SOLDIERS THE BOAT WAS WHIRLED UP THE MOUNTAIN OF WATER LIKE A LEAF ON A WATER SPOUT AND A SECOND FLASH OF LIGHTNING SHOWED THEM WHAT SEEMED A GROUP OF DOLLS STRUGGLING IN THE SURF AND A WALNUT SHELL BOTTOM UPWARDS WAS DRIVEN
3807-4955-0012 BY THE RECOIL OF THE WAVES TOWARDS THEM FOR AN INSTANT ALL THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST SHARE THE FATE WHICH HAD OVERTAKEN THE UNLUCKY CONVICTS BUT BURGESS SUCCEEDED IN TRIMMING THE BOAT AND AWED BY THE PERIL HE HAD SO NARROWLY ESCAPED GAVE THE ORDER TO RETURN
3807-4955-0013 AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
3807-4955-0014 AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
3807-4955-0015 FATE HAD IN RESERVE FOR THE CREW OF VILLAINS A LESS MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THAT OF DROWNING AIDED BY THE LIGHTNING AND THAT WONDERFUL GOOD LUCK WHICH URGES VILLAINY TO ITS DESTRUCTION VETCH BEACHED THE BOAT AND THE PARTY BRUISED AND BLEEDING
3807-4955-0016 REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
3807-4955-0017 AND PASSED OVER HIS SPRAWLING BODY TO THE SHORE COX GRASPING AT ANYTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF CLUTCHED AN OAR AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUND HIMSELF BORNE OUT WITH THE OVERTURNED WHALE BOAT BY THE UNDER TOW HE WAS DRIFTED PAST HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESCUE THE GUARD BOAT
3807-4955-0018 WITH A VELOCITY THAT FORBADE ALL ATTEMPTS AT RESCUE AND ALMOST BEFORE THE POOR SCOUNDREL HAD TIME TO REALIZE HIS CONDITION HE WAS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY OF ESCAPING THE HANGING THAT HIS COMRADES HAD SO OFTEN HUMOROUSLY PROPHESIED FOR HIM
3807-4955-0019 BEING A STRONG AND VIGOROUS VILLAIN HOWEVER HE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO HIS OAR AND EVEN UNBUCKLING HIS LEATHER BELT PASSED IT ROUND THE SLIP OF WOOD THAT WAS HIS SALVATION GIRDING HIMSELF TO IT AS FIRMLY AS HE WAS ABLE
3807-4955-0020 IN THIS CONDITION PLUS A SWOON FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS DESCRIED BY THE HELMSMAN OF THE PRETTY MARY A FEW MILES FROM CAPE SURVILLE AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING
3807-4955-0021 LOWERED A BOAT AND PICKED HIM UP NEARLY BISECTED BY THE BELT GORGED WITH SALT WATER FROZEN WITH COLD AND HAVING TWO RIBS BROKEN THE VICTIM OF VETCH'S MURDEROUS QUICKNESS RETAINED SUFFICIENT LIFE TO SURVIVE BLUNT'S REMEDIES FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS
3807-4955-0022 DURING THAT TIME HE STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS COX THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PORT ARTHUR WITH EIGHT OTHERS THAT JOHN REX WAS THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL DROWNED AND THAT HE BELIEVED JOHN REX HAD BEEN RETAKEN HAVING PLACED BLUNT IN POSSESSION OF THESE PARTICULARS
3807-4955-0023 HE FURTHER SAID THAT IT PRICKED HIM TO BREATHE CURSED JEMMY VETCH THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SEA AND SO IMPENITENTLY DIED BLUNT SMOKED THREE PIPES AND THEN ALTERED THE COURSE OF THE PRETTY MARY TWO POINTS TO THE EASTWARD AND RAN FOR THE COAST
3807-4955-0024 IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WAS SEARCHING HAD NOT BEEN RETAKEN AND WAS EVEN NOW AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL IT WAS CLEARLY HIS DUTY HEARING OF THE PLANNED ESCAPE HAVING BEEN ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED NOT TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHILE HOPE REMAINED
3807-4955-0025 THE PRETTY MARY HUGGING THE COAST AS CLOSELY AS SHE DARED CRAWLED IN THE THIN BREEZE ALL DAY AND SAW NOTHING IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO LAND AT CAPE SURVILLE FOR THE WHOLE STATION WOULD BE ON THE ALERT SO BLUNT AS NIGHT WAS FALLING
3807-4955-0026 STOOD OFF A LITTLE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF PIRATES BAY HE WAS WALKING THE DECK GROANING AT THE FOLLY OF THE EXPEDITION WHEN A STRANGE APPEARANCE ON THE SOUTHERN HORN OF THE BAY MADE HIM COME TO A SUDDEN HALT THERE WAS A FURNACE BLAZING IN THE BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN
3807-4955-0027 BLUNT RUBBED HIS EYES AND STARED HE LOOKED AT THE MAN AT THE HELM DO YOU SEE ANYTHING YONDER JEM JEM A SYDNEY MAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ROUND THAT COAST BEFORE BRIEFLY REMARKED LIGHTHOUSE
3807-4955-0028 BLUNT STUMPED INTO THE CABIN AND GOT OUT HIS CHARTS NO LIGHTHOUSE WAS LAID DOWN THERE ONLY A MARK LIKE AN ANCHOR AND A NOTE REMARKABLE HOLE AT THIS POINT A REMARKABLE HOLE INDEED
3807-4955-0029 A REMARKABLE LIME KILN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE BLUNT CALLED UP HIS MATE WILLIAM STAPLES A FELLOW WHOM SARAH PURFOY'S GOLD HAD BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL WILLIAM STAPLES LOOKED AT THE WAXING AND WANING GLOW FOR A WHILE
3807-4955-0030 AND THEN SAID IN TONES TREMBLING WITH GREED IT'S A FIRE LIE TO AND LOWER AWAY THE JOLLY BOAT OLD MAN THAT'S OUR BIRD FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS THE PRETTY MARY SHORTENED SAIL AND BLUNT AND STAPLES GOT INTO THE JOLLY BOAT
3807-4955-0031 GOIN A HOYSTERIN SIR SAID ONE OF THE CREW WITH A GRIN AS BLUNT THREW A BUNDLE INTO THE STERN SHEETS STAPLES THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK THE OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE WAS NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CAREFULLY PICKED CREW
3807-4955-0032 BLUNT HAD NOT CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LIKELY TO BETRAY HIM THOUGH FOR THAT MATTER REX HAD SUGGESTED A PRECAUTION WHICH RENDERED BETRAYAL ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
3807-4955-0033 CLOTHES RETURNED BLUNT WE CAN'T BRING HIM OFF IF IT IS HIM IN HIS CANARIES HE PUTS ON THESE DUDS D'YE SEE SINKS HER MAJESTY'S LIVERY AND COMES ABOARD A SHIPWRECKED MARINER THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OF WHOSE NOTION'S THAT
3807-4955-0034 THE MADAM'S I'LL BE BOUND AY SHE'S A KNOWING ONE AND THE SINISTER LAUGHTER OF THE PAIR FLOATED ACROSS THE VIOLET WATER GO EASY MAN SAID BLUNT AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE AT EAGLEHAWK AND IF THOSE CURSED DOGS GIVE TONGUE
3807-4955-0035 THERE'LL BE A BOAT OUT IN A TWINKLING IT'S LUCKY THE WIND'S OFF SHORE STAPLES LAY ON HIS OAR AND LISTENED THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS AND THE SHIP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THEY WERE APPROACHING THE PROMONTORY FROM THE SOUTH EAST
3807-4955-0036 AND THIS ISTHMUS OF THE GUARDED NECK WAS HIDDEN BY THE OUTLYING CLIFF IN THE SOUTH WESTERN ANGLE OF THIS CLIFF ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE SEA WAS AN ARCH WHICH VOMITED A RED AND FLICKERING LIGHT THAT FAINTLY SHONE UPON THE SEA IN THE TRACK OF THE BOAT
3807-4955-0037 THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
3807-4955-0038 STOOPING AND RISING AS THOUGH FEEDING THE FIRE ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT A DOOR IN VULCAN'S SMITHY
3807-4955-0039 AND THAT THE OLD HERO WAS FORGING ARMS FOR A DEMIGOD BLUNT TURNED PALE IT'S NO MORTAL HE WHISPERED LET'S GO BACK AND WHAT WILL MADAM SAY RETURNED DARE DEVIL WILL STAPLES WHO WOULD HAVE PLUNGED INTO MOUNT EREBUS HAD HE BEEN PAID FOR IT
