39-121914-0000 EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
39-121914-0001 VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
39-121914-0002 THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
39-121914-0003 THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
39-121914-0004 SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
39-121914-0005 IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
39-121914-0006 THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
39-121914-0007 AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
39-121914-0008 THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
39-121914-0009 HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
39-121914-0010 AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
39-121914-0011 WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
39-121914-0012 WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
39-121914-0013 ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
39-121914-0014 RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
39-121914-0015 FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
39-121914-0016 AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
39-121914-0017 BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
39-121914-0018 THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
39-121914-0019 BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
39-121914-0020 MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION
39-121914-0021 WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
39-121914-0022 AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
39-121914-0023 BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
39-121914-0024 AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
39-121914-0025 YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
39-121914-0026 THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
39-121914-0027 I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
39-121914-0028 HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
39-121914-0029 AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY
39-121914-0030 WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
39-121914-0031 WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AND ALWAYS WELCOME AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER
39-121914-0032 MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
39-121914-0033 I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
39-121914-0034 I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
39-121914-0035 POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE
39-121914-0036 IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
39-121914-0037 I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME MY DEAREST PAPA
39-121914-0038 WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
39-121914-0039 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
39-121914-0040 SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
39-121914-0041 AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
39-121914-0042 MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
39-121914-0043 AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
39-121914-0044 MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
39-121914-0045 AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
39-121914-0046 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121914-0047 IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
39-121914-0048 YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
39-121914-0049 AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
39-121914-0050 AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
39-121914-0051 UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
39-121914-0052 POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
39-121914-0053 THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
39-121914-0054 AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION MY DEAR
39-121914-0055 ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
39-121914-0056 I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
