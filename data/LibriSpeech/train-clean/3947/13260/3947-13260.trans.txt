3947-13260-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN NO ONE IN ALL RAYMOND INCLUDING THE RECTANGLE FELT LOREEN'S DEATH MORE KEENLY THAN VIRGINIA IT CAME LIKE A DISTINCT PERSONAL LOSS TO HER
3947-13260-0001 THAT SHORT WEEK WHILE THE GIRL HAD BEEN IN HER HOME HAD OPENED VIRGINIA'S HEART TO A NEW LIFE SHE WAS TALKING IT OVER WITH RACHEL THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL
3947-13260-0002 I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY MONEY TO HELP THOSE WOMEN TO A BETTER LIFE VIRGINIA LOOKED OVER TO THE END OF THE HALL WHERE THE DAY BEFORE LOREEN'S BODY HAD LAIN I HAVE DECIDED ON A GOOD PLAN AS IT SEEMS TO ME
3947-13260-0003 I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH ROLLIN HE WILL DEVOTE A LARGE PART OF HIS MONEY ALSO TO THE SAME PLAN HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU VIRGINIA TO GIVE IN THIS WAY ASKED RACHEL ONCE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED SUCH A PERSONAL QUESTION
3947-13260-0004 NOW IT SEEMED AS NATURAL TO TALK FRANKLY ABOUT MONEY AS ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE THAT BELONGED TO GOD I HAVE AVAILABLE FOR USE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ROLLIN HAS AS MUCH MORE
3947-13260-0005 IT IS ONE OF HIS BITTER REGRETS NOW THAT HIS EXTRAVAGANT HABITS OF LIFE BEFORE HIS CONVERSION PRACTICALLY THREW AWAY HALF THAT FATHER LEFT HIM WE ARE BOTH EAGER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION IN OUR POWER WHAT WOULD JESUS DO WITH THIS MONEY
3947-13260-0006 WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HONESTLY AND WISELY THE MONEY I SHALL PUT INTO THE NEWS IS I AM CONFIDENT IN A LINE WITH HIS PROBABLE ACTION
3947-13260-0007 IT IS AS NECESSARY THAT WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SALOON INFLUENCE TO MEET AS IT IS TO HAVE A CHURCH OR A COLLEGE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MISTER NORMAN WILL KNOW HOW TO USE SO WELL
3947-13260-0008 WILL BE A POWERFUL FACTOR IN RAYMOND TO DO AS JESUS WOULD ABOUT MY OTHER PLAN RACHEL I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME
3947-13260-0009 THE FIELD WHERE THE TENT NOW IS HAS BEEN IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS WE MEAN TO SECURE THE ENTIRE TRACT AS SOON AS THE COURTS HAVE SETTLED THE TITLE FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN MAKING A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS AND RESIDENCE METHODS
3947-13260-0010 OF CHRISTIAN WORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN THE HEART OF GREAT CITY SLUMS I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO TELL JUST WHAT IS THE WISEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN RAYMOND BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH
3947-13260-0011 MY MONEY I MEAN GOD'S WHICH HE WANTS ME TO USE CAN BUILD WHOLESOME LODGING HOUSES REFUGES FOR POOR WOMEN ASYLUMS FOR SHOP GIRLS SAFETY FOR MANY AND MANY A LOST GIRL LIKE LOREEN
3947-13260-0012 AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE SIMPLY A DISPENSER OF THIS MONEY GOD HELP ME I DO WANT TO PUT MYSELF INTO THE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW RACHEL I HAVE A FEELING ALL THE TIME THAT ALL THAT LIMITLESS MONEY AND LIMITLESS PERSONAL SACRIFICE CAN POSSIBLY DO
3947-13260-0013 WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
3947-13260-0014 THE SALOON FURNISHES MATERIAL TO BE SAVED FASTER THAN THE SETTLEMENT OR RESIDENCE OR RESCUE MISSION WORK CAN SAVE IT VIRGINIA SUDDENLY ROSE AND PACED THE HALL RACHEL ANSWERED SADLY AND YET WITH A NOTE OF HOPE IN HER VOICE
3947-13260-0015 BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
3947-13260-0016 I BELIEVE THAT TOO THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAVE PROMISED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD IS INCREASING IF WE ONCE HAVE SAY FIVE HUNDRED SUCH DISCIPLES IN RAYMOND THE SALOON IS DOOMED
3947-13260-0017 BUT NOW DEAR I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR PART IN THIS PLAN FOR CAPTURING AND SAVING THE RECTANGLE YOUR VOICE IS A POWER I HAVE HAD MANY IDEAS LATELY HERE IS ONE OF THEM YOU COULD ORGANIZE AMONG THE GIRLS A MUSICAL INSTITUTE
3947-13260-0018 GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR TRAINING THERE ARE SOME SPLENDID VOICES IN THE ROUGH THERE DID ANY ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SINGING AS THAT YESTERDAY BY THOSE WOMEN RACHEL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
3947-13260-0019 YOU SHALL HAVE THE BEST OF MATERIAL IN THE WAY OF ORGANS AND ORCHESTRAS THAT MONEY CAN PROVIDE AND WHAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH MUSIC TO WIN SOULS THERE INTO HIGHER AND PURER AND BETTER LIVING
3947-13260-0020 BEFORE VIRGINIA HAD CEASED SPEAKING RACHEL'S FACE WAS PERFECTLY TRANSFORMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HER LIFE WORK IT FLOWED INTO HER HEART AND MIND LIKE A FLOOD AND THE TORRENT OF HER FEELING OVERFLOWED IN TEARS THAT COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED
3947-13260-0021 IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF DOING HERSELF IT REPRESENTED TO HER SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT WAS IN KEEPING WITH A RIGHT USE OF HER TALENT YES SHE SAID AS SHE ROSE AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0022 WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
3947-13260-0023 IF WE HAVE SUCH A LEVER AS CONSECRATED MONEY TO MOVE THINGS WITH ADD TO IT CONSECRATED PERSONAL ENTHUSIASM LIKE YOURS AND IT CERTAINLY CAN ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS SAID VIRGINIA SMILING
3947-13260-0024 ROLLIN CAME BACK AND SAT DOWN AND TOGETHER THE THREE DISCUSSED THEIR FUTURE PLANS ROLLIN WAS APPARENTLY ENTIRELY FREE FROM EMBARRASSMENT IN RACHEL'S PRESENCE WHILE VIRGINIA WAS WITH THEM ONLY HIS MANNER WITH HER WAS ALMOST PRECISE IF NOT COLD
3947-13260-0025 THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13260-0026 AFTER A WHILE ROLLIN WAS CALLED OUT AND RACHEL AND VIRGINIA BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS BY THE WAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF JASPER CHASE VIRGINIA ASKED THE QUESTION INNOCENTLY BUT RACHEL FLUSHED AND VIRGINIA ADDED WITH A SMILE
3947-13260-0027 I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0028 RACHEL SPOKE WITH THE FRANKNESS THAT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS JASPER CHASE TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT THAT HE IN FACT HE PROPOSED TO ME OR HE WOULD IF
3947-13260-0029 RACHEL STOPPED AND SAT WITH HER HANDS CLASPED ON HER LAP AND THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES VIRGINIA I THOUGHT A LITTLE WHILE AGO I LOVED HIM AS HE SAID HE LOVED ME BUT WHEN HE SPOKE MY HEART FELT REPELLED AND I SAID WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY
3947-13260-0030 I TOLD HIM NO I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST CONVERSIONS AT THE RECTANGLE I AM GLAD FOR YOU SAID VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHY ASKED RACHEL A LITTLE STARTLED
3947-13260-0031 BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER REALLY LIKED JASPER CHASE HE IS TOO COLD AND I DO NOT LIKE TO JUDGE HIM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS DISTRUSTED HIS SINCERITY IN TAKING THE PLEDGE AT THE CHURCH WITH THE REST
3947-13260-0032 RACHEL LOOKED AT VIRGINIA THOUGHTFULLY I HAVE NEVER GIVEN MY HEART TO HIM I AM SURE HE TOUCHED MY EMOTIONS AND I ADMIRED HIS SKILL AS A WRITER I HAVE THOUGHT AT TIMES THAT I CARED A GOOD DEAL FOR HIM
3947-13260-0033 I THINK PERHAPS IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME AT ANY OTHER TIME THAN THE ONE HE CHOSE I COULD EASILY HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I LOVED HIM BUT NOT NOW AGAIN RACHEL PAUSED SUDDENLY AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT VIRGINIA AGAIN THERE WERE TEARS ON HER FACE
3947-13260-0034 VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
3947-13260-0035 BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL HURT THAT RACHEL HAD KEPT BACK SOMETHING SHE WAS SIMPLY CONSCIOUS OF MORE ON RACHEL'S MIND THAN SHE HAD REVEALED VERY SOON ROLLIN CAME BACK AND HE AND VIRGINIA ARM IN ARM AS THEY HAD LATELY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG HALL
3947-13260-0036 IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
3947-13260-0037 DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
3947-13260-0038 AND THEN GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE RECTANGLE THE BENEFIT OF HER CULTURE AND HER VOICE IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SELF SACRIFICE REPLIED ROLLIN A LITTLE STIFFLY VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE SHARPLY
3947-13260-0039 BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
3947-13260-0040 NEITHER CAN I IMAGINE MISS HE SPOKE THE NAME OF THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL WHO HAD BEGGED VIRGINIA TO TAKE THE GIRLS TO THE RECTANGLE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING VIRGINIA ANY MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE MISTER
3947-13260-0041 VIRGINIA SPOKE THE NAME OF A YOUNG SOCIETY LEADER GOING ABOUT TO THE CLUBS DOING YOUR WORK ROLLIN THE TWO WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE HALL COMING BACK TO RACHEL BEGAN VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0042 ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
3947-13260-0043 ROLLIN SUDDENLY STOPPED HE SEEMED DEEPLY AGITATED HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S AND WALKED ALONE TO THE END OF THE HALL THEN HE RETURNED WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND STOPPED NEAR HIS SISTER AND SAID
3947-13260-0044 VIRGINIA HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED MY SECRET VIRGINIA LOOKED BEWILDERED THEN OVER HER FACE THE UNUSUAL COLOR CREPT SHOWING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT RACHEL WINSLOW ROLLIN SPOKE CALMLY ENOUGH NOW
3947-13260-0045 THAT DAY SHE WAS HERE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HER REFUSAL TO JOIN THE CONCERT COMPANY I ASKED HER TO BE MY WIFE OUT THERE ON THE AVENUE SHE REFUSED ME AS I KNEW SHE WOULD AND SHE GAVE AS HER REASON THE FACT THAT I HAD NO PURPOSE IN LIFE WHICH WAS TRUE ENOUGH
3947-13260-0046 NOW THAT I HAVE A PURPOSE NOW THAT I AM A NEW MAN DON'T YOU SEE VIRGINIA HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING I OWE MY VERY CONVERSION TO RACHEL'S SINGING
3947-13260-0047 AND YET THAT NIGHT WHILE SHE SANG I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT FOR THE TIME BEING I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER VOICE EXCEPT AS GOD'S MESSAGE I BELIEVE THAT ALL MY PERSONAL LOVE FOR HER WAS FOR THE TIME MERGED INTO A PERSONAL LOVE TO MY GOD AND MY SAVIOUR
3947-13260-0048 ROLLIN WAS SILENT THEN HE WENT ON WITH MORE EMOTION I STILL LOVE HER VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0049 HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
3947-13260-0050 THE FIRM LIPS SHOWING MANHOOD AND COURAGE THE CLEAR EYES LOOKING INTO HERS FRANKLY THE FORM STRONG AND GRACEFUL ROLLIN WAS A MAN NOW WHY SHOULD NOT RACHEL COME TO LOVE HIM IN TIME
