40-121026-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
40-121026-0001 INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
40-121026-0002 OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
40-121026-0003 SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
40-121026-0004 LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
40-121026-0005 THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
40-121026-0006 APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
40-121026-0007 WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
40-121026-0008 I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
40-121026-0009 SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
40-121026-0010 ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
40-121026-0011 LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
40-121026-0012 AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
40-121026-0013 I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
40-121026-0014 SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
40-121026-0015 NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
40-121026-0016 SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
40-121026-0017 AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
40-121026-0018 ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
40-121026-0019 AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
40-121026-0020 I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
40-121026-0021 NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
40-121026-0022 I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
40-121026-0023 I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
40-121026-0024 AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
40-121026-0025 AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
40-121026-0026 THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
40-121026-0027 WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
40-121026-0028 SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
40-121026-0029 I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
40-121026-0030 I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
40-121026-0031 HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
40-121026-0032 AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
40-121026-0033 THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
40-121026-0034 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
40-121026-0035 UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
40-121026-0036 IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
40-121026-0037 AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
40-121026-0038 YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
40-121026-0039 AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
40-121026-0040 I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
40-121026-0041 MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
40-121026-0042 BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
40-121026-0043 HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
40-121026-0044 HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
