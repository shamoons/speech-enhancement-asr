40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0001 MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
40-222-0002 THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
40-222-0003 SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
40-222-0004 IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
40-222-0005 THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
40-222-0006 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0007 BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
40-222-0008 THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
40-222-0009 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
40-222-0010 CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
40-222-0011 AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
40-222-0012 MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
40-222-0013 THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
40-222-0014 UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
40-222-0015 AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0017 SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0019 AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
40-222-0020 AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
40-222-0021 THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
40-222-0022 AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
40-222-0023 HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
40-222-0024 SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
40-222-0025 THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
40-222-0026 I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
40-222-0027 THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
40-222-0028 LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
40-222-0029 OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
40-222-0030 TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
40-222-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
40-222-0032 WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
40-222-0033 DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
40-222-0034 AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
40-222-0035 FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
40-222-0036 THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
40-222-0037 AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
40-222-0038 AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
40-222-0039 AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
40-222-0040 SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
40-222-0041 LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
40-222-0042 NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
40-222-0043 I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
40-222-0044 IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
40-222-0045 I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
40-222-0046 I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT

40-222-0056 WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
