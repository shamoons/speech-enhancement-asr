4014-186175-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE TIMELY RESCUE IT WAS NO PLEASANT THOUGHT TO CONTEMPLATE THE PRESENCE OF A BOLD
4014-186175-0001 THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING ANY LENGTHS IF NECESSARY ALREADY HAD BEEN PROVED AND THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EVIL GENIUS MIGHT COME IN HORRIBLE FORM AT ANY INSTANT NEVERTHELESS
4014-186175-0002 WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
4014-186175-0003 IT WAS A CASE OF WATCH EVERYBODY TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION AND BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING ONLY NINE MEN ON THE VESSEL HOWEVER INCLUDING THE SPY HIMSELF KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
4014-186175-0004 REFRESHED BY THEIR SLEEP JERRY AND SLIM AROSE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON JOE WHO HAD RESTED EASILY THROUGHOUT THE LATER EXCITEMENT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT WAS STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WAS NOT THEN TO BE FOUND
4014-186175-0005 JERRY HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SO SLIM WENT TO THE UPPER DECK ALONE
4014-186175-0006 AND HIS MIND WEIGHTED ANYWAY WITH THE MENACING MYSTERY OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SAT DOWN ON A COIL OF ROPE JUST IN THE LEE OF THE FORWARD SMOKESTACK TO THINK THE WHOLE MATTER OVER FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE WAS THUS ABSORBED WHEN SOMETHING AT FIRST VAGUE AND INDEFINITE THEN CLEARER
4014-186175-0007 LIKE THE AWAKENING CALL THAT COMES TO A MAN IN A SOUND SLEEP
4014-186175-0008 TO FIND SOMEONE STANDING DIRECTLY OVER HIM LOUDLY AND INSISTENTLY CALLING HIS NAME
4014-186175-0009 A CRACKLING MERELY FROM THE PRESSURE WITHIN FOR A MOMENT SLIM THOUGHT AN OVER WROUGHT IMAGINATION WAS PLAYING TRICKS UPON HIM BUT HE ROSE HASTILY AND CROSSED THE SHORT INTERVENING DISTANCE
4014-186175-0010 WAS RAPPING DESPERATELY UPON THAT PIPE AND IN THE LONG AND SHORT DASHES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE THAT SOMEONE WAS REPEATING A SINGLE WORD HELP HELP HELP IN ANOTHER INSTANT USING THE HEAVY END OF HIS JACKKNIFE AS A CRUDE TRANSMITTER SLIM WAS TAPPING OFF THE REPLY
4014-186175-0011 WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THE MESSAGE BEGAN TO COME BACK
4014-186175-0012 CAN'T MAKE SELF HEARD CAN YOU HELP THIS IS SLIM THE YOUTH RAPPED BACK UPON THE PIPE CAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE ON DECK AM COMING WITH HELP AT ONCE AND HE DASHED DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS ALMOST BOWLING OVER THE CAPTAIN'S AIDE AS HE HURTLED INTO THE SANCTUM OF THE SHIP'S COMMANDER UNANNOUNCED
4014-186175-0013 WELL THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED STERNLY WHY ALL THE HASTE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SLIM BLURTED OUT HE'S LOCKED IN A CLOSET DOWN NEAR THE ENGINE ROOM LOCKED IN A CLOSET THE CAPTAIN REPEATED INCREDULOUSLY HOW DO YOU KNOW
4014-186175-0014 HE GAVE A TELEGRAPHIC CALL FOR HELP ON THE STEAM PIPE WHICH RUNS THROUGH THERE AND CONNECTS WITH THE WHISTLE THE LAD EXPLAINED I WAS ON DECK AND HEARD IT I TALKED WITH HIM OVER THE PIPE THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE THEN COME WITH ME AND THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF HURRIEDLY LED THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186175-0015 FOR A FEW STEPS THEY FELT THEIR WAY ALONG AND THEN STOPPED TO LISTEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE DULL AND CONSTANT HUM OF THE ENGINES AND THE ALMOST INSUFFERABLE HEAT
4014-186175-0016 THEY STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN FAINT AND INDISTINCT APPARENTLY FROM SOMEWHERE SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THEM THEY BOTH HEARD REPEATED THAT WHICH HAD MADE SLIM STOP
4014-186175-0017 THE LAD REPEATED THEM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186175-0018 M O T H E R I N G
4014-186175-0019 AND HE STARTED DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY TOWARD A NARROW STAIRS LEADING TO A STILL LOWER CHAMBER IN THE VESSEL THREE TURNS TWO TO THE RIGHT AND ONE TO THE LEFT AND THE CAPTAIN STOPPED AGAIN TO LISTEN SEEMINGLY FROM WITHIN THE WALL RIGHT AT THEIR ELBOWS THERE CAME A FEEBLE KNOCK
4014-186175-0020 THE OFFICER WHIPPED OUT A POCKET FLASHLIGHT THEY WERE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A HEAVY WOODEN DOOR IT WAS LOCKED
4014-186175-0021 AND SLIM HASTENED AWAY TO RETURN TWO MINUTES LATER WITH ALL THREE TOOLS
4014-186175-0022 BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN
4014-186175-0023 TWO MORE ATTEMPTS AND THE PANEL FELL IN STRIPS TO THE FLOOR THUS GIVEN SOMETHING FOR A GRIP HOLD THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A MASSIVE MAN TOOK HOLD WITH BOTH HANDS
4014-186175-0024 BROUGHT THE ENTIRE DOOR FROM ITS HINGES
4014-186175-0025 THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LIEUTENANT MACKINSON TUMBLED OUT UPON THE FLOOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE FROM SUFFOCATION THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED THREE SHORT SHARP BLASTS UPON A WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND TWO OILERS CAME RUNNING TO THE SPOT
4014-186175-0026 HELP US CARRY THIS MAN TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY HE ORDERED HE HAS BEEN OVERCOME
4014-186175-0027 HE HAD RELAPSED AGAIN AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES BUT THIS TIME THE LIEUTENANT'S MIND WAS CLEARING SOMEBODY SHOVED ME IN THAT CLOSET HE GASPED AND THEN SLAMMED AND LOCKED THE DOOR HE RECOGNIZED THE CAPTAIN AND THE DOCTOR
4014-186175-0028 FOUND HIM LOCKED IN A SMALL COMPARTMENT DOWN NEAR THE AUXILIARY ENGINE ROOM THE COMMANDER SAID BRIEFLY
4014-186175-0029 HE MADE HIS WHEREABOUTS KNOWN BY TAPPING A MESSAGE ON A STEAM PIPE
4014-186175-0030 NEARLY SUFFOCATED TOO
4014-186175-0031 HIS HEART ACTION IS PRETTY WEAK EVEN YET
4014-186175-0032 AT THAT MOMENT JERRY CAME HURRYING DOWN THE DECK HE WAS VISIBLY EXCITED BUT
4014-186175-0033 AND SO EVEN AS TWO MEN CARRIED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON AWAY HE REMAINED STANDING AT SALUTE WAITING FOR THE CAPTAIN TO RECOGNIZE HIM WITH A RETURN OF THE SALUTE AND NOW WHAT ASKED THE CAPTAIN JERRY STEPPED FORWARD WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING HIS EXCITEMENT
4014-186175-0034 WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND THIS LYING UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED HIS LEFT HAND IN IT LAY A PIECE OF LIGHT CHAIN BOTH ENDS BROKEN BESIDE IT HE CONTINUED WAS THIS NOTE FROM HIS POCKET HE EXTRACTED A PIECE OF PAPER THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE ROUGHLY TORN
4014-186175-0035 LET THIS BE A WARNING THAT NO FURTHER INTERFERENCE WILL BE OF AVAIL THE CAPTAIN LOOKED FROM THE NOTE TO THE CHAIN
4014-186175-0036 AND NO SIGNATURE I BELIEVE SIR SAID JERRY
4014-186175-0037 THE SENIOR OFFICER OF THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE CROSS WITH ITS TWO BITS OF CHAIN STILL DANGLING FROM IT HE PLACED THE ENDS TO THE CHAIN WHICH JERRY HAD FOUND IN THE WIRELESS ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SIMPLY AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
4014-186175-0038 APPEARED EQUALLY ANXIOUS A MAN IS DISCOVERED AT NIGHT IN THE BATTERY ROOM OF THE WIRELESS DEPARTMENT OF THIS SHIP CLEARLY UPON AN UNFRIENDLY MISSION SAID THE CAPTAIN HALF TO HIMSELF AND HALF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHERS SUMMING UP THE EVIDENCE THUS FAR KNOWN TO THEM
4014-186175-0039 A FEW HOURS LATER THAT SAME NIGHT HE RETURNS TO THE BATTERY ROOM AND SUCCEEDS IN RECOVERING THE PORTABLE INSTRUMENT TO DAY LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WHILE PURSUING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIR
4014-186175-0040 IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
4014-186175-0041 WE ARE NOT SAFE WHILE HE IS FREE
