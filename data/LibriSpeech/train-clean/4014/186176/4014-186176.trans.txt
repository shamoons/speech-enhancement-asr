4014-186176-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE DEATH OF THE SPY
4014-186176-0001 THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186176-0002 PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
4014-186176-0003 AND YOU STOOPED TO PICK UP WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
4014-186176-0004 EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
4014-186176-0005 I WAS GROPING MY WAY ALONG WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD STEPS JUST AHEAD OF ME I STOPPED TO LISTEN AND WHEN THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED I PROCEEDED ONWARD
4014-186176-0006 BEFORE I COULD UTTER A WORD I WAS A PRISONER BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND
4014-186176-0007 EVERY MOMENT IT BECAME MORE STIFLING IN THERE AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I HAD WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A DEATH TRAP IT WAS THEN I BEGAN SIGNALING ON THE STEAM PIPE I GUESS IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR ME THAT SLIM GOODWIN STROLLED OUT ON DECK JUST AT THE TIME HE DID
4014-186176-0008 AND THAT WAS ALL THAT LIEUTENANT MACKINSON COULD TELL THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER REMAINED WHAT HE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST A DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWN SPY
4014-186176-0009 PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO DEVISE A SCHEME OF CAPTURE WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE GOOD REASON FOR WANTING TO GET THIS FELLOW SLIM REMINDED THE OTHERS WITH CONSIDERABLE WARMTH
4014-186176-0010 TO WHICH HE IS AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THAT KNOCKOUT THAT HE HANDED TO JOE AND THE MIDNIGHT SCARE HE GAVE JERRY AND ME AND FINALLY HIS EFFORT TO KILL LIEUTENANT MACKINSON BY SLOW SUFFOCATION
4014-186176-0011 WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
4014-186176-0012 WELL WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION SLIM DEMANDED THAT WE DIVIDE OUR FORCES ANSWERED JOE SOLEMNLY LIE IN WAIT AND TRY TO AMBUSH THE FOE RIGHT CRIED JERRY JOE YOU'LL BE A GENERAL BEFORE THIS WAR'S OVER
4014-186176-0013 ALONG WHAT LINES DO WE DISPERSE OUR FORCES GENERAL ASKED SLIM ALONG WHAT LINES WOULD HIS ROYAL STOUTNESS SUGGEST DEMANDED JERRY OH YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING ME THAT I'M A TRIFLE HEAVY SLIM REPLIED IN A PEEVISH TONE
4014-186176-0014 A TRIFLE HEAVY GET THAT WILL YOU ECHOED JERRY WITH A GALE OF LAUGHTER A TRIFLE HEAVY OH MY YOU'LL FIND OUT IF I SIT ON YOU SLIM THREATENED IN A BELLIGERENT TONE
4014-186176-0015 WON'T DO IT SLIM MUTTERED OH YES YOU WILL COUNSELED JOE SHAKE HANDS THE TWO OF YOU SLIM'S GOOD NATURE OVERCAME HIS FEIGNED RELUCTANCE BUT AS JERRY GRASPED HIS HAND HE GAVE JERRY A JERK THAT NEARLY TOOK HIM OFF HIS FEET NOW WE'RE SQUARE SAID SLIM
4014-186176-0016 AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
4014-186176-0017 THE LIEUTENANT COULD BE IN THE WIRELESS ROOM AND ONE OF US IN THE BATTERY ROOM WHILE THE OTHER TWO DID DUTY OUTSIDE
4014-186176-0018 IT WOULD BE TIRESOME AND MONOTONOUS WORK ALL RIGHT
4014-186176-0019 I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
4014-186176-0020 WELL I'LL COVER THE BATTERY ROOM SAID SLIM IGNORING JERRY'S REMARK LET'S SEE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THEN SUGGESTED JOE AND THEY WENT TO FIND THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO WAS CONVALESCING FROM HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SPY WHEN HE HAD APPROVED THE PLAN THEY GOT THE O K OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186176-0021 TO THE THREE BOYS UNABLE TO SEE OR TALK TO EACH OTHER AND JOE AND JERRY SCARCELY DARING TO MOVE THE MINUTES LAGGED LIKE HOURS
4014-186176-0022 BLACK ENDLESS NIGHTS DAWN CAME
4014-186176-0023 THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
4014-186176-0024 I WILL ARRANGE FOR ANOTHER MAN TO STAY IN THE WIRELESS ROOM DURING TO DAY
4014-186176-0025 THE SEA IS CALM AND WE READILY COULD DISCERN A PERISCOPE A LONG DISTANCE AWAY TRULY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND IT WAS IN THIS ALLURING QUIET OF SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE PEACE
4014-186176-0026 THE BRIGHTON BOYS AND THEIR FRIEND AND SUPERIOR OFFICER THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN IN THEIR APPOINTED PLACES HARDLY MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN JOE AND JERRY AT THE SAME INSTANT CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE ON THE DECK ABOVE
4014-186176-0027 IT CAME NEARER AND CLEARER UNTIL FINALLY AS IT REACHED A POINT NEAR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY UNDER WHICH JOE WAS CONCEALED THE LATTER COULD DISCERN THE FOG HORN VOICE OF THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER
4014-186176-0028 THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
4014-186176-0029 YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
4014-186176-0030 YE DIRTY HOUND I'VE A MIND TO BOOT YE INTO THE SEA
4014-186176-0031 AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
4014-186176-0032 SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN A VOICE SO STERN IT MADE JOE WINCE
4014-186176-0033 HE'S A THIRD CLASS MACHINIST SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
4014-186176-0034 YES AND I BELIEVE HE'S WORSE THAN THAT THE CAPTAIN ADDED
4014-186176-0035 THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN
4014-186176-0036 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'D CAUGHT THE MAN THE DOCTOR WHISPERED
4014-186176-0037 THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM JOE FOLLOWED BY A LOUDER HOLY SMOKE FROM SLIM DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN THE CAPTAIN ASKED IN A SHARP TONE I SHOULD SAY I DO SIR JOE RESPONDED
4014-186176-0038 HE IS THE MAN WHO WAS PLANTING AMMUNITION IN THE WATERS NEAR THE NAVY YARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE VERY SAME ONE SIR SLIM EXCLAIMED WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THE SHIP'S SURGEON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE OTHERS UPON DECK STEPPED CLOSER FOR A BETTER INSPECTION OF THIS ENEMY
4014-186176-0039 AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PRISONER
4014-186176-0040 AND THRUST THE ENGINEER FROM HIM BEFORE ANYONE COULD INTERFERE HE WAS DASHING DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE STERN JUST AS HE TOOK A WILD HEADLONG LEAP OVER THE RAIL THE CAPTAIN FIRED WHILE THE CAPTAIN THROUGH A SPEAKING TUBE WAS INSTRUCTING THE MAN IN THE PILOT HOUSE TO SIGNAL BELOW REVERSE ENGINES
4014-186176-0041 THE OTHERS RUSHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP FAR BEHIND THEM IN THE FOAMY TRAIL LEFT ON THE MOONLIT WATER BY THE VESSEL THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HEAD OF A MAN BOBBING UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE SHIP WAS TURNED
4014-186176-0042 GONE SAID THE CAPTAIN IN TONES OF VERY EVIDENT RELIEF WELL IT WAS DEATH FOR HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND HE TOOK HIS CHOICE AS THE CAPTAIN AND SURGEON MOVED AWAY FROM THE STERN RAIL OF THE EVERETT
4014-186176-0043 AND MADE ME RUN A MILE IN NOTHING FLAT ADDED JERRY AND FOUGHT ME TO A KNOCKOUT FINISH LATER MUSED JOE AND NEARLY SMOTHERED ME TO DEATH SPOKE THE LIEUTENANT AND WAS FINALLY CORRALLED BY AN IRISH ENGINEER SAID SLIM GONE CONCLUDED JERRY
