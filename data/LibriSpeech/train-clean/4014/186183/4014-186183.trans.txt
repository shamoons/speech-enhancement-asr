4014-186183-0000 FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
4014-186183-0001 BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
4014-186183-0002 FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH AVIATORS HAD BEEN REPORTING HEAVY GERMAN FORMATIONS IN THAT REGION EVIDENTLY WITH THE DESIGN OF A TERRIFIC ASSAULT BUT THE ALLIED COMMANDERS HAD NOT EXPECTED IT SO SOON AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR IT
4014-186183-0003 IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
4014-186183-0004 AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
4014-186183-0005 INCLUDING FOOD AND AMMUNITION TRAINS
4014-186183-0006 EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING
4014-186183-0007 OR LIFELESS BEFORE SUPERIOR NUMBERS
4014-186183-0008 A STATIONARY BALLOON SHOWED WHERE JERRY AND AN OBSERVATION OFFICER WERE DOING DUTY ON THAT FATEFUL DAY JERRY WAS OPERATING A TELEPHONE THAT RAN DIRECTLY TO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS AND HARDLY A MOMENT PASSED WHEN HE WAS NOT REPEATING SOME OBSERVATION OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE BASKET WITH HIM
4014-186183-0009 EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
4014-186183-0010 WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
4014-186183-0011 TO MAKE SURE THAT THUS FAR HIS FRIEND WAS STILL SAFE
4014-186183-0012 THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
4014-186183-0013 IT WAS NOW WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON THE GERMANS HAD SWEPT INTO THE PLACES VACATED BY THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH AND STILL THE BATTLE RAGED IT WAS NOW THAT SLIM BEGAN TO WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT
4014-186183-0014 THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH HAD RETREATED TO A GENERAL LINE WHICH PERMITTED A QUICK RE MOBILIZATION TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THERE THEIR FRONT LINE RANKS HELD FIRM WHILE THE NEW FORMATION WAS BEING EFFECTED BEHIND THEM IT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THIS WAS COMPLETE
4014-186183-0015 AND SOON IN GREAT MEASURE AT LEAST HOSTILITIES WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THE NIGHT THEIR WORK COMPLETED
4014-186183-0016 SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0017 AND THE HEAVY ROAR OF THE ARTILLERY ALSO WAS PUNCTUATED WITH LONGER PAUSES
4014-186183-0018 WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
4014-186183-0019 TAKING OFF THE GRIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND WONDERING WHERE JERRY WAS KEEPING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE WHEN SUDDENLY A VERY STRANGE THING HAPPENED BEYOND THE ENEMY'S LINE
4014-186183-0020 MORE EASILY HANDLED AEROPLANES AND USED IN GREAT NUMBERS BY THE GERMANS SHOT INTO THE AIR AT GREAT SPEED FROM BEHIND THE BOCHE ENTRENCHMENTS
4014-186183-0021 IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
4014-186183-0022 AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
4014-186183-0023 STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER
4014-186183-0024 HE POINTED HER NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARD THE AMERICAN LINES FOUR AMERICAN PLANES SAILED OFF AND UPWARD TO MEET THE ONCOMING GERMAN AIR ARMADA BUT FROM THE GROUND IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE MAN IN THE OBSERVER'S PLACE IN THE TAUBE WAS MAKING DESPERATE SIGNALS
4014-186183-0025 THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
4014-186183-0026 AND THE OTHER GERMAN PLANES TURNED BACK TOWARD THEIR OWN LINES THE TAUBE CONTINUED ON ITS WAVERING CRIPPLED DOWNWARD COURSE TOWARD THE ALLIED LINES
4014-186183-0027 AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
4014-186183-0028 OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
4014-186183-0029 AND AFTER DESCENDING A LITTLE BY PERMITTING SOME OF THE GAS TO ESCAPE WE JUMPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BASKET AND CAME DOWN ON OUR PARACHUTES
4014-186183-0030 BUT SOME OTHER GERMAN AVIATORS SAW THE AFFAIR APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED OUR UNIFORMS AND HARDLY GAVE US TIME TO MAKE A DECENT START SAY JERRY CONCLUDED THEY CERTAINLY DID PEBBLE US WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS
4014-186183-0031 OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
