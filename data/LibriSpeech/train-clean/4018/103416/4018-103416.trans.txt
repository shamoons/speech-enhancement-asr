4018-103416-0000 THE WINTER WHICH PRECEDED THE ENTRANCE OF THE UNITED STATES INTO THE WAR WAS SOCIALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE IT WAS MARKED BY AN ALMOST FEVERISH GAYETY AS THOUGH HAVING APPARENTLY DETERMINED TO PURSUE A POLICY DICTATED PURELY BY SELF INTEREST
4018-103416-0001 MILLS AND FACTORIES TOOK ON NEW LIFE LABOR WAS SCARCE AND HIGH IT WAS A PERIOD OF EXTRAVAGANCE RATHER THAN PLEASURE PEOPLE PLAYED THAT THEY MIGHT NOT THINK WASHINGTON CONVINCED THAT THE NATION WOULD ULTIMATELY BE INVOLVED
4018-103416-0002 KEPT ITS SECRET WELL AND CONTINUED TO PREACH A NEUTRALITY IT COULD NOT ENFORCE WAR WAS TO MOST OF THE NATION A GREAT DRAMATIC SPECTACLE PRESENTED TO THEM AT BREAKFAST AND IN THE AFTERNOON EDITIONS
4018-103416-0003 FOR THE RED CROSS AND KINDRED ACTIVITIES BUT ALTHOUGH THE WAR WAS IN THE NATION'S MIND IT WAS NOT YET IN ITS SOUL LIFE WENT ON MUCH AS BEFORE AN ABIDING FAITH IN THE ALLIES WAS THE FOUNDATION STONE OF ITS COMPLACENCY
4018-103416-0004 THE GREAT SIX MONTHS BATTLE OF THE SOMME WITH ITS MILLION CASUALTIES WAS RESULTING FAVORABLY ON THE EAST THE RUSSIANS HAD MADE SOME GAINS THERE WERE WAGERS THAT THE GERMANS WOULD BE DONE IN THE SPRING
4018-103416-0005 BUT AGAIN WASHINGTON KNEW THAT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH LOSSES AT THE SOMME HAD BEEN FRIGHTFUL THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOST TERRITORY REGAINED WAS NEGLIGIBLE AS AGAINST THE TERRITORY STILL HELD THAT THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS WAS ACUTE
4018-103416-0006 THAT THE SUBMARINE SINKINGS WERE COLOSSAL OUR PEACE WAS AT A FEARFUL COST AND ON THE EDGE OF THIS VOLCANO AMERICA PLAYED WHEN GRAHAM SPENCER LEFT THE MILL THAT TUESDAY AFTERNOON IT WAS TO VISIT MARION HAYDEN
4018-103416-0007 HE WAS RATHER BORED NOW AT THE PROSPECT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED GOING TO THE CLUB TO PLAY BILLIARDS WHICH WAS HIS CUSTOM OF A LATE AFTERNOON HE DROVE RATHER MORE SLOWLY THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM AND SO MISSED MARION'S INVITATION TO GET THERE BEFORE THE CROWD
4018-103416-0008 THREE CARS BEFORE THE HOUSE SHOWED THAT SHE ALREADY HAD CALLERS AND INDEED WHEN THE PARLOR MAID OPENED THE DOOR A BURST OF LAUGHTER GREETED HIM THE HAYDEN HOUSE WAS A GENERAL RENDEZVOUS THERE WERE USUALLY BY SEVEN O'CLOCK WHISKEY AND SODA GLASSES
4018-103416-0009 AND TEA CUPS ON MOST OF THE FURNITURE AND HALF SMOKED CIGARETS ON EVERYTHING THAT WOULD HOLD THEM INCLUDING THE PIANO MARION HERSELF MET HIM IN THE HALL AND LED HIM PAST THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR
4018-103416-0010 I KEPT THE LIBRARY AS LONG AS I COULD WE CAN SIT ON THE STAIRS IF YOU LIKE WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO DO QUITE AMIABLY FROM VARIOUS OPEN DOORS CAME SUBDUED VOICES THE AIR WAS PUNGENT WITH TOBACCO SMOKE
4018-103416-0011 PERMEATED WITH A FAINT SCENT OF LATE AFTERNOON HIGHBALLS TOMMY MARION CALLED WHEN SHE HAD SETTLED HERSELF YES FROM A DISTANCE DID YOU LEAVE YOUR CIGARET ON THE PIANO
4018-103416-0012 NO TOOTS DEAR BUT I CAN EASILY MOTHER MARION EXPLAINED
4018-103416-0013 WELL DO YOU REMEMBER HALF THE PRETTY THINGS YOU TOLD ME LAST NIGHT NOT EXACTLY BUT I MEANT THEM HE LOOKED UP AT HER ADMIRINGLY HE WAS ONLY A YEAR FROM COLLEGE AND HE HAD BEEN RATHER ARBITRARILY LIMITED TO THE DEBUTANTES
4018-103416-0014 SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD BEEN RANKLING UNDER A SENSE OF YOUTH WAS I PRETTY AWFUL LAST NIGHT HE ASKED YOU WERE VERY INTERESTING AND I IMAGINE RATHER INDISCREET
4018-103416-0015 ABOUT THE NEW WAR CONTRACTS OH BUSINESS
4018-103416-0016 AND I LIKE BIG FIGURES POOR PEOPLE ALWAYS DO HAS IT REALLY GONE THROUGH I MEAN THOSE THINGS DO SLIP UP SOMETIMES DON'T THEY IT'S GONE THROUGH ALL RIGHT SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED
4018-103416-0017 ENCOURAGED BY HER INTEREST HE ELABORATED ON THE NEW WORK HE EVEN DEVELOPED AN ENTHUSIASM FOR IT TO HIS OWN SURPRISE AND THE GIRL LISTENED INTENTLY LEANING FORWARD SO THAT HER ARM BRUSHED HIS SHOULDER
4018-103416-0018 HER EYES SLIGHTLY NARROWED WATCHED HIM CLOSELY SHE KNEW EVERY MOVE OF THE GAME SHE WAS DETERMINING TO PLAY MARION HAYDEN AT TWENTY FIVE KNEW ALREADY WHAT HER LITTLE WORLD HAD NOT YET REALIZED THAT SUCH BEAUTY AS SHE HAD HAD
4018-103416-0019 WAS THE BEAUTY OF YOUTH ONLY AND THAT THAT WAS GOING LATE HOURS GOLF PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE CHAMPAGNE THAN WAS NECESSARY AT DINNERS AND THE MORNINGS FOUND HER ALMOST PLAIN AND TOO
4018-103416-0020 SHE HAD THE FAR VISION OF THE CALCULATING MIND SHE KNEW THAT IF THE COUNTRY ENTERED THE WAR EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN SHE KNEW WOULD IMMEDIATELY VOLUNTEER AT TWENTY FIVE SHE ALREADY NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE PERSONNEL OF HER FOLLOWERS
4018-103416-0021 WERE NOW SENDING FLOWERS TO THE DEBUTANTES AND CUTTING IN ON THE YOUNGER MEN AT BALLS HER HOUSE WAS STILL A RENDEZVOUS BUT IT WAS FOR COUPLES LIKE THE ONES WHO HAD PREEMPTED THE DRAWING ROOM THE LIBRARY AND THE MUSIC ROOM THAT AFTERNOON
4018-103416-0022 THEY MET THERE SMOKED HER CIGARETS MADE LOVE IN A CORNER OCCASIONALLY BECAME ENGAGED BUT SHE WAS OF THE GAME NO LONGER IN IT MEN STILL CAME TO SEE HER A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THEM MARRIED
4018-103416-0023 THEY BROUGHT OR SENT HER TRIBUTE FLOWERS CANDY AND CIGARETS
4018-103416-0024 BUT MORE AND MORE HER DINNER INVITATIONS WERE FROM THE OLDER CROWD LIKE NATALIE SPENCER'S STUPID PARTY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SHE WATCHED GRAHAM AND LISTENED HE WAS A NICE BOY AND A HANDSOME ONE
4018-103416-0025 ALSO HE PROMISED TO BE SOLE HEIR TO A GREAT BUSINESS IF THE WAR ONLY LASTED LONG ENOUGH IMAGINE YOUR KNOWING ALL THOSE THINGS SHE SAID ADMIRINGLY YOU'RE A PARTNER AREN'T YOU HE FLUSHED SLIGHTLY

4018-103416-0028 HE HELD HIMSELF VERY STRAIGHT AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE BOYISH GRIN WITH WHICH HE CUSTOMARILY GREETED THE BUTLER HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A DIGNIFIED NOD NATALIE WAS IN HER DRESSING ROOM AT HIS KNOCK SHE TOLD THE MAID TO ADMIT HIM
4018-103416-0029 HIS NEW FOUND MATURITY SEEMED TO BE SLIPPING FROM HIM SOMEHOW HERE AT HOME THEY ALWAYS MANAGED TO MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A SMALL BOY HONESTLY MOTHER I'D RATHER GO TO FATHER AND TELL HIM ABOUT IT
4018-103416-0030 SHE IGNORED HIS PROTEST AS SHE ALWAYS IGNORED PROTESTS AGAINST HER OWN METHODS OF HANDLING MATTERS I'M ACCUSTOMED TO IT WAS HER SOLE REPLY BUT HER RESIGNED VOICE BROUGHT HER AS IT ALWAYS HAD
4018-103416-0031 THE READY TRIBUTE OF THE BOY'S SYMPATHY SIT DOWN GRAHAM I WANT TO TALK TO YOU HE SAT DOWN STILL UNEASILY FINGERING THE ROLL OF BILLS
4018-103416-0032 WHEN AT A SOUND IN CLAYTON'S ROOM HE STUCK THE MONEY HASTILY INTO HIS POCKET HAVE YOU NOTICED A CHANGE IN YOUR FATHER SINCE HE CAME BACK HER TONE WAS SO OMINOUS THAT HE STARTED HE'S NOT SICK IS HE

4018-103416-0034 YOUR FATHER NEEDS YOU HE NEEDS ME THE HELL OF A LOT THE BOY MUTTERED BUT HE WENT OVER AND STOOPING DOWN KISSED HER TREMBLING FACE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME HE SAID LIGHTLY I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT SPINE ENOUGH TO GET INTO THE MIX UP ANYHOW
4018-103416-0035 AND IF WE HAVE YOU WON'T GO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GO WHEN HE HESITATED SHE RESORTED TO HER OLD METHODS WITH BOTH CLAYTON AND THE BOY SHE WAS DOING ALL SHE COULD TO MAKE THEM HAPPY SHE MADE NO DEMANDS NONE
4018-103416-0036 BUT WHEN SHE ASKED FOR SOMETHING THAT MEANT MORE THAN LIFE TO HER IT WAS REFUSED OF COURSE SHE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL SORTS OF HUMILIATION TO GET HIM THAT MONEY AND THIS WAS THE GRATITUDE SHE RECEIVED GRAHAM LISTENED
4018-103416-0037 SHE WAS A REALLY PATHETIC FIGURE CROUCHED IN HER LOW CHAIR AND SHAKEN WITH TERROR SHE MUST HAVE RATHER A BAD TIME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS SHE DARED NOT TAKE TO HIS FATHER SHE BROUGHT THEM TO HIM INSTEAD HER SMALL GRIEVANCES
4018-103416-0038 AND SHE HAD HELPED HIM OUT OF A HOLE JUST NOW ALL RIGHT I PROMISE HE SAID AT LAST BUT YOU'RE WORRYING YOURSELF FOR NOTHING MOTHER SHE WAS QUITE CONTENT THEN CHEERED AT ONCE CONSULTED THE JEWELLED WATCH ON HER DRESSING TABLE
