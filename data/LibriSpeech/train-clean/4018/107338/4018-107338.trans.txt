4018-107338-0000 MORLEY PAUSED AS HE RECOGNISED EGREMONT THEN ADVANCING TO GERARD FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION HE SAID THIS IS MISTER HATTON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AND WHO CLAIMS TO BE AN ANCIENT ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
4018-107338-0001 PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY OF YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER SAID HATTON SCANNING GERARD WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYE AND THEN HE ADDED HE WAS OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME IN MY YOUTH AND ONE IS NOT APT TO FORGET SUCH THINGS
4018-107338-0002 AND I VENTURE TO BELIEVE MY PRAYERS AND VIGILS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED
4018-107338-0003 AND AS HE WAS SPEAKING THESE WORDS HE TURNED AND ADDRESSED THEM TO SYBIL SHE BEHELD HIM WITH NO LITTLE INTEREST THIS MYSTERIOUS NAME THAT HAD SOUNDED SO OFTEN IN HER YOUNG EARS
4018-107338-0004 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY STRANGE AND HIGH HOPES AND SOME DARK BLENDING OF DOUBT AND APPREHENSION AND DISCORDANT THOUGHTS HATTON IN HIS APPEARANCE REALISED LITTLE OF THE FANCIES
4018-107338-0005 THAT APPEARANCE WAS PREPOSSESSING A FRANK AND EVEN BENEVOLENT EXPRESSION PLAYED UPON HIS INTELLIGENT AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE HIS ONCE RICH BROWN HAIR STILL LONG THOUGH VERY THIN
4018-107338-0006 DETRACT FROM THE FAVOURABLE EFFECT THAT HE ALWAYS AT ONCE PRODUCED
4018-107338-0007 IS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE PEOPLE OF WHOM I AM ONE SAID HATTON BOWING WELL RECOLLECTING THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING THE DAUGHTER OF A CHARTIST DELEGATE BUT IS YOUR LABOUR THEIR LABOUR SAID SYBIL
4018-107338-0008 IS YOURS THAT LIFE OF UNCOMPLAINING TOIL WHEREIN THERE IS SO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND OF GOODNESS THAT BY THE FINE MAXIM OF OUR CHURCH IT IS HELD TO INCLUDE THE FORCE AND EFFICACY OF PRAYER
4018-107338-0009 THEN HESITATING WHILE A SOFT EXPRESSION CAME OVER HER COUNTENANCE SHE HELD FORTH HER HAND WHICH HE RETAINED FOR A MOMENT AND WITHDREW I WAS WITH HIM MORE THAN AN HOUR CONTINUED MORLEY AT FIRST HE RECOLLECTED NOTHING
4018-107338-0010 HE DOUBTLESS HAD THEM NOW AS HE NEVER DESTROYED PAPERS WOULD ORDER A SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR THEM AND SO ON I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HE ASKED ME CARELESSLY A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR FATHER WHAT HE WAS DOING AND WHETHER HE WERE MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN
4018-107338-0011 THIS LED TO A VERY LONG CONVERSATION IN WHICH HE SUDDENLY SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST AT FIRST HE TALKED OF WRITING TO SEE YOUR FATHER AND I OFFERED THAT GERARD SHOULD CALL UPON HIM
4018-107338-0012 HE TOOK DOWN YOUR DIRECTION IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT WRITE TO YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM AN APPOINTMENT WHEN OBSERVING THAT IT WAS WESTMINSTER HE SAID THAT HIS CARRIAGE WAS ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THAT IF NOT INCONVENIENT TO ME
4018-107338-0013 HE WOULD PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD AT ONCE ACCOMPANY HIM I THOUGHT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RESULT IT MUST BE A SATISFACTION TO GERARD AT LAST TO SEE THIS MAN OF WHOM HE HAS TALKED AND THOUGHT SO MUCH AND SO WE ARE HERE
4018-107338-0014 YOU DID WELL GOOD STEPHEN AS YOU ALWAYS DO SAID SYBIL WITH A MUSING AND ABSTRACTED AIR NO ONE HAS SO MUCH FORETHOUGHT AND SO MUCH ENERGY AS YOU HE THREW A GLANCE AT HER AND IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW IT THEIR EYES HAD MET
4018-107338-0015 HERS WERE KIND AND CALM AND THIS EGREMONT SAID MORLEY RATHER HURRIEDLY AND ABRUPTLY AND LOOKING ON THE GROUND HOW CAME HE HERE WHEN WE DISCOVERED HIM YESTERDAY YOUR FATHER AND MYSELF AGREED THAT WE SHOULD NOT MENTION TO YOU THE
4018-107338-0016 THE MYSTIFICATION OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN DUPES AND YOU DID WRONG SAID SYBIL THERE IS NO WISDOM LIKE FRANKNESS HAD YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY HE MET AND ADDRESSED ME AND I ONLY RECOGNISED AN ACQUAINTANCE
4018-107338-0017 HAD HE NOT ACCOMPANIED ME TO THIS DOOR AND MET MY FATHER WHICH PRECIPITATED AN EXPLANATION ON HIS PART WHICH HE FOUND HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN BY OTHERS I MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN AN IGNORANCE WHICH HEREAFTER MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED INCONVENIENCE
4018-107338-0018 YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MORLEY LOOKING AT HER RATHER KEENLY WE HAVE ALL OF US OPENED OURSELVES TOO UNRESERVEDLY BEFORE THIS ARISTOCRAT I SHOULD HOPE THAT NONE OF US HAVE SAID TO HIM A WORD THAT WE WISH TO BE FORGOTTEN SAID SYBIL
4018-107338-0019 HE CHOSE TO WEAR A DISGUISE AND CAN HARDLY QUARREL WITH THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH WE SPOKE OF HIS ORDER OR HIS FAMILY AND FOR THE REST HE HAS NOT BEEN INJURED FROM LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE BY LIVING AMONG THEM
4018-107338-0020 AND YET IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO MORROW SAID MORLEY REST ASSURED THIS MAN HAS HIS EYE ON US HE CAN WALK INTO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES LIKE THEMSELVES AND TELL HIS TALE FOR THOUGH ONE OF THE PSEUDO OPPOSITION THE MOMENT THE PEOPLE MOVE
4018-107338-0021 THE FACTIONS BECOME UNITED SYBIL TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN SAID AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MORROW THAT WE SHOULD CARE FOR THE GOVERNMENT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH IT OR US DO NOT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING DO NOT YOU MEET IN THEIR VERY SIGHT
4018-107338-0022 YOU PURSUE AN AVOWED AND LEGAL AIM BY LEGAL MEANS DO YOU NOT WHAT THEN IS THERE TO FEAR AND WHY SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN THAT SHOULD MAKE US APPREHENSIVE ALL IS VERY WELL AT THIS MOMENT SAID MORLEY AND ALL MAY CONTINUE WELL
4018-107338-0023 BUT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES BREED TURBULENT SPIRITS SYBIL YOUR FATHER TAKES A LEADING PART HE IS A GREAT ORATOR AND IS IN HIS ELEMENT IN THIS CLAMOROUS AND FIERY LIFE IT DOES NOT MUCH SUIT ME I AM A MAN OF THE CLOSET
4018-107338-0024 MORLEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SAID AN EASY QUESTION QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS EASY THE FACT IS IN ACTIVE LIFE ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO REFINE I COULD HAVE WISHED THE MOVEMENT TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT SHAPE
4018-107338-0025 LAWFULLY MEETING IN OPEN DAY AND THEIR DELEGATES FROM THE WHOLE REALM DECLARING THEIR GRIEVANCES IN LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD NOT DISGRACE THE CONQUERING RACE WHICH HAS IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO DEGRADE THEM
4018-107338-0026 THERE CAN BE OTHER THAN ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT A THOUSAND SAID MORLEY WE HAVE ALREADY AS MANY PARTIES AS IN SAINT STEPHEN'S ITSELF YOU TERRIFY ME SAID SYBIL I KNEW WE HAD FEARFUL ODDS TO COMBAT AGAINST
4018-107338-0027 MY VISIT TO THIS CITY ALONE HAS TAUGHT ME HOW STRONG ARE OUR ENEMIES BUT I BELIEVED THAT WE HAD ON OUR SIDE GOD AND TRUTH THEY KNOW NEITHER OF THEM IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION SAID MORLEY
4018-107338-0028 THE FACTIONS AND THE FAILURES OF OUR OPPRESSORS AT THIS MOMENT GERARD AND HATTON WHO WERE SITTING IN THE REMOTE PART OF THE ROOM ROSE TOGETHER AND ADVANCED FORWARD AND THIS MOVEMENT INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION OF SYBIL AND MORLEY
4018-107338-0029 SAYING IN A VOICE WHICH COULD ONLY BE HEARD BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM HE ADDRESSED YOU UNDERSTAND I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT MYSELF OF YOUR MORAL RIGHT I BELIEVE ON EVERY PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE THAT MOWBRAY CASTLE IS AS MUCH YOURS
4018-107338-0030 AS THE HOUSE THAT IS BUILT BY THE TENANT ON THE LORD'S LAND BUT CAN WE PROVE IT WE NEVER HAD THE LEGAL EVIDENCE YOU ARE IN ERROR IN SUPPOSING THAT THESE PAPERS WERE OF ANY VITAL CONSEQUENCE MERE MEMORANDA
4018-107338-0031 VERY USEFUL NO DOUBT I HOPE I SHALL FIND THEM BUT OF NO VALIDITY IF MONEY WERE THE ONLY DIFFICULTY TRUST ME IT SHOULD NOT BE WANTING I OWE MUCH TO THE MEMORY OF YOUR FATHER MY GOOD GERARD I WOULD FAIN SERVE YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER
4018-107338-0032 I'LL NOT TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO FOR YOU MY GOOD GERARD YOU WOULD THINK ME FOOLISH BUT I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD AND SEEING YOU AGAIN AND TALKING OF OLD TIMES I REALLY AM SCARCELY FIT FOR BUSINESS
