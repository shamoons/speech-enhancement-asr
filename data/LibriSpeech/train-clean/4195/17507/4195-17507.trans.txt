4195-17507-0016 INDEED THE SUN DID COME OUT BUT ONLY TO GIVE A DISCOURAGED LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AND RETIRE AGAIN
4195-17507-0017 THEY HAD SUNSHINE RAIN HAIL SNOW AND A TORNADO AND THEN RAIN AGAIN AND MORE SUNSHINE SUNNY ITALY SEEMED A MISNOMER THAT DAY AS INDEED IT DOES MANY DAYS IN WINTER AND SPRING
4195-17507-0018 WHEN THE CLIMATE IS LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT PREVAILING IN THE EASTERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AND PERHAPS ONE SUFFERS MORE IN ITALY THAN IN AMERICA OWING TO THE GENERAL LACK OF MEANS TO KEEP WARM ON COLD DAYS THE ITALIAN
4195-17507-0019 FOR HE WILL PERMIT NO REPROACH TO LIE ON HIS BELOVED LAND BUT THE TRAVELLER FREQUENTLY BECOMES DISCOURAGED AND THE AMERICAN CONTINGENT ESPECIALLY
4195-17507-0020 EXAGGERATED THE CONDITIONS BY APOSTROPHIZING THE COUNTRY AS SUNNY ITALY AND FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY UTTERED SUCH RHAPSODIES IN ITS PRAISE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CREDITED THEM UNTIL IT ACQUIRED PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE MATTER
4195-17507-0021 ITALY IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS CHARMING AND DELIGHTFUL BUT SELDOM IS THIS TRUE IN WINTER OR EARLY SPRING THE HORSES WENT ALONG AT A SPANKING PACE THAT WAS ASTONISHING THEY PASSED THROUGH THE PICTURESQUE LANES OF SORRENTO CLIMBED
4195-17507-0022 THE FURTHER SLOPE AND BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PENINSULA WHERE THE GIRLS OBTAINED THEIR FIRST VIEW OF THE GULF OF SALERNO WITH THE LOVELY ISLES OF THE SIRENS LYING JUST BENEATH THEM
4195-17507-0023 AND HAS NO DUPLICATE IN ALL THE KNOWN WORLD
4195-17507-0024 RISING STRAIGHT FROM THE SEA WHICH THE HIGHWAY OVERHANGS AT AN AVERAGE HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET THE TRAVELLER BEING PROTECTED ONLY BY A LOW STONE PARAPET FROM THE VAST GULF THAT YAWNS BENEATH
4195-17507-0025 AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD THE CLIFFS CONTINUE TO ASCEND A LIKE DISTANCE TOWARD THE SKY
4195-17507-0026 PILGRIMS WHEN IT RAINED THEY PUT UP THE CARRIAGE TOP WHICH AFFORDED BUT PARTIAL SHELTER
4195-17507-0027 FROM THAT DISTANCE THE BOATS DRAWN UPON THE SHELTERED BEACH SEEMED LIKE MERE TOYS THEN THEY WOULD SPAN A CHASM ON A NARROW STONE BRIDGE OR PLUNGE THROUGH AN ARCH DIVIDING THE SOLID MOUNTAIN
4195-17507-0028 WHEN THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE DAY OVERTOOK THEM WITHOUT WARNING THE WIND CAME WHISTLING AROUND THEM IN A GREAT GALE WHICH SPEEDILY INCREASED IN FURY UNTIL IT DROVE THE BLINDED HORSES REELING AGAINST THE LOW PARAPET
4195-17507-0029 AND PUSHED UPON THE CARRIAGE AS IF DETERMINED TO DASH IT OVER THE PRECIPICE AS IT COLLIDED AGAINST THE STONE WALL THE VEHICLE TIPPED DANGEROUSLY HURLING THE DRIVER FROM HIS SEAT TO DIVE HEADFOREMOST INTO THE SPACE BENEATH
4195-17507-0030 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT A MOUNTED HORSEMAN WHO UNOBSERVED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE PARTY DASHED TO THEIR RESCUE THE RIDER CAUGHT THE PLUNGING STEEDS BY THEIR HEADS AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN THEIR TERROR AT HIS OWN EMINENT PERIL
4195-17507-0031 WHILE THE CARRIAGE LAY WEDGED AGAINST THE WALL AND THE DRIVER SCREAMED PITIFULLY FROM HIS DANGEROUS POSITION MIDWAY BETWEEN SEA AND SKY
4195-17507-0032 WEIGHT JUST ABOVE WAS A SLIGHT LEDGE HE COULD REACH IT NOW AND THEN SHE HAD HIM BY THE ARM SO THAT ANOTHER INSTANT FOUND HIM CLINGING TO THE PARAPET AND DRAWING HIMSELF INTO A POSITION OF SAFETY
4195-17507-0033 THE HORSES AS SOON AS THE STRAIN UPON THEIR BITS WAS RELAXED WERE EASILY QUIETED
4195-17507-0034 THE ADVENTURE WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE PERIL WAS PAST AND ALL WAS WELL AGAIN UNCLE JOHN LEAPED FROM THE CARRIAGE FOLLOWED BY LOUISE AND PATSY
4195-17507-0035 SO OPPORTUNELY WAS NONE OTHER THAN COUNT FERRALTI
4195-17507-0036 HE WAS SITTING UPON HIS HORSE AND STARING WITH AMAZEMENT AT BETH
4195-17507-0037 BY EVERY SAINT IN THE CALENDAR THAT THE GIRL HAD SAVED HIM FROM A FRIGHTFUL DEATH AND HE WOULD DEVOTE HIS FUTURE LIFE TO HER SERVICE IT IS WONDERFUL MURMURED FERRALTI

4195-17507-0039 WE'D BETTER GET BACK TO SORRENTO SAID UNCLE JOHN ABRUPTLY
4195-17507-0040 THAT IS IF YOU PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU
4195-17507-0041 AS IF THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN A MOMENT'S FEAR IN THEIR LIVES SO THE GIRLS AND THEIR UNCLE CLIMBED INTO THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND THE DRIVER MOUNTED THE BOX AND CRACKED HIS WHIP WITH HIS USUAL VIGOR
4195-17507-0042 THE WIND HAD SUBSIDED AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD ARISEN AND AS THEY PASSED THROUGH POSITANO WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH
4195-17507-0043 COUNT FERRALTI RODE AT THE SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE BUT DID NOT ATTEMPT MUCH CONVERSATION
4195-17507-0044 NOW A HOTEL MUCH FAVORED BY THE TOURIST COUNT FERRALTI PROMISED TO JOIN THEM LATER AND RODE ON TO THE TOWN TO FIND A SURGEON TO LOOK AFTER HIS INJURED HAND WHILE THE OTHERS SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LONG INCLINES LEADING IN A ZIGZAG FASHION UP TO THE OLD MONASTERY
4195-17507-0045 WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN THE YEAR TWELVE TWELVE FROM THE ARBORED VERANDA OF THIS CHARMING RETREAT IS OBTAINED ONE OF THE FINEST VIEWS IN EUROPE AND WHILE THE GIRLS SAT ENJOYING IT UNCLE JOHN ARRANGED WITH A PLEASANT FACED WOMAN
4195-17507-0046 WHO HAD ONCE LIVED IN AMERICA FOR THEIR LUNCHEON AN HOUR LATER AND JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO THE MEAL COUNT FERRALTI REJOINED THEM
4195-17507-0047 IN SPITE OF HIS COURAGE HE COULD EAT NO LUNCHEON BUT MERELY SIPPED A GLASS OF WINE SO UNCLE JOHN ALARMED AT HIS PALLOR INSISTED THAT HE TAKE A SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE ON THE RETURN JOURNEY
4195-17507-0048 AND BETH MOUNTED THE BOX AND RODE BESIDE HER FRIEND THE DRIVER
