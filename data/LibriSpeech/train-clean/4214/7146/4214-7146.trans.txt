4214-7146-0000 DIANA IS INVITED TO TEA WITH TRAGIC RESULTS OCTOBER WAS A BEAUTIFUL MONTH AT GREEN GABLES
4214-7146-0001 WHEN THE BIRCHES IN THE HOLLOW TURNED AS GOLDEN AS SUNSHINE AND THE MAPLES BEHIND THE ORCHARD WERE ROYAL CRIMSON AND THE WILD CHERRY TREES ALONG THE LANE PUT ON THE LOVELIEST SHADES OF DARK RED AND BRONZY GREEN WHILE THE FIELDS SUNNED THEMSELVES IN AFTERMATHS
4214-7146-0002 ANNE REVELED IN THE WORLD OF COLOR ABOUT HER OH MARILLA SHE EXCLAIMED ONE SATURDAY MORNING COMING DANCING IN WITH HER ARMS FULL OF GORGEOUS BOUGHS

4214-7146-0013 AND THEN PRESSING HER TO TAKE ANOTHER PIECE OF FRUIT CAKE AND ANOTHER HELPING OF PRESERVES OH MARILLA IT'S A WONDERFUL SENSATION JUST TO THINK OF IT CAN I TAKE HER INTO THE SPARE ROOM TO LAY OFF HER HAT WHEN SHE COMES AND THEN INTO THE PARLOR TO SIT NO

4214-7146-0021 DIANA HAD MUCH TO TELL ANNE OF WHAT WENT ON IN SCHOOL SHE HAD TO SIT WITH GERTIE PYE AND SHE HATED IT
4214-7146-0022 RUBY GILLIS HAD CHARMED ALL HER WARTS AWAY TRUE'S YOU LIVE WITH A MAGIC PEBBLE THAT OLD MARY JOE FROM THE CREEK GAVE HER

4214-7146-0026 ANNE LOOKED ON THE SECOND SHELF OF THE ROOM PANTRY BUT THERE WAS NO BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL THERE SEARCH REVEALED IT AWAY BACK ON THE TOP SHELF ANNE PUT IT ON A TRAY AND SET IT ON THE TABLE WITH A TUMBLER
4214-7146-0027 NOW PLEASE HELP YOURSELF DIANA SHE SAID POLITELY I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL HAVE ANY JUST NOW I DON'T FEEL AS IF I WANTED ANY AFTER ALL THOSE APPLES
4214-7146-0028 DIANA POURED HERSELF OUT A TUMBLERFUL LOOKED AT ITS BRIGHT RED HUE ADMIRINGLY AND THEN SIPPED IT DAINTILY THAT'S AWFULLY NICE RASPBERRY CORDIAL ANNE SHE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW RASPBERRY CORDIAL WAS SO NICE
4214-7146-0029 THERE ARE SO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES ON A PERSON'S MIND WHEN THEY'RE KEEPING HOUSE ISN'T THERE
4214-7146-0030 THE TUMBLERFULS WERE GENEROUS ONES AND THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL WAS CERTAINLY VERY NICE THE NICEST I EVER DRANK SAID DIANA IT'S EVER SO MUCH NICER THAN MISSUS LYNDE'S ALTHOUGH SHE BRAGS OF HERS SO MUCH
4214-7146-0031 IT DOESN'T TASTE A BIT LIKE HERS I SHOULD THINK MARILLA'S RASPBERRY CORDIAL WOULD PROB'LY BE MUCH NICER THAN MISSUS LYNDE'S SAID ANNE LOYALLY MARILLA IS A FAMOUS COOK
4214-7146-0032 I WAS THINKING THE LOVELIEST STORY ABOUT YOU AND ME DIANA I THOUGHT YOU WERE DESPERATELY ILL WITH SMALLPOX AND EVERYBODY DESERTED YOU BUT I WENT BOLDLY TO YOUR BEDSIDE AND NURSED YOU BACK TO LIFE
4214-7146-0033 AND THEN I TOOK THE SMALLPOX AND DIED AND I WAS BURIED UNDER THOSE POPLAR TREES IN THE GRAVEYARD AND YOU PLANTED A ROSEBUSH BY MY GRAVE AND WATERED IT WITH YOUR TEARS
4214-7146-0034 OH IT WAS SUCH A PATHETIC TALE DIANA THE TEARS JUST RAINED DOWN OVER MY CHEEKS WHILE I MIXED THE CAKE BUT I FORGOT THE FLOUR AND THE CAKE WAS A DISMAL FAILURE FLOUR IS SO ESSENTIAL TO CAKES YOU KNOW MARILLA WAS
4214-7146-0035 VERY CROSS AND I DON'T WONDER I'M A GREAT TRIAL TO HER SHE WAS TERRIBLY MORTIFIED ABOUT THE PUDDING SAUCE LAST WEEK WE HAD A PLUM PUDDING FOR DINNER ON TUESDAY AND THERE WAS HALF THE PUDDING AND A PITCHERFUL OF SAUCE LEFT OVER
4214-7146-0036 MARILLA SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER DINNER AND TOLD ME TO SET IT ON THE PANTRY SHELF AND COVER IT I MEANT TO COVER IT JUST AS MUCH AS COULD BE DIANA BUT WHEN I CARRIED IT IN I WAS IMAGINING I WAS A NUN OF COURSE I'M A PROTESTANT BUT I IMAGINED I WAS A CATHOLIC
4214-7146-0037 TAKING THE VEIL TO BURY A BROKEN HEART IN CLOISTERED SECLUSION AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT COVERING THE PUDDING SAUCE I THOUGHT OF IT NEXT MORNING AND RAN TO THE PANTRY DIANA
4214-7146-0038 FANCY IF YOU CAN MY EXTREME HORROR AT FINDING A MOUSE DROWNED IN THAT PUDDING SAUCE I LIFTED THE MOUSE OUT WITH A SPOON AND THREW IT OUT IN THE YARD AND THEN I WASHED THE SPOON IN THREE WATERS
4214-7146-0039 BUT WHEN SHE DID COME IN I WAS IMAGINING THAT I WAS A FROST FAIRY GOING THROUGH THE WOODS TURNING THE TREES RED AND YELLOW WHICHEVER THEY WANTED TO BE SO I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PUDDING SAUCE AGAIN AND MARILLA SENT ME OUT TO PICK APPLES
4214-7146-0040 YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY STYLISH PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MISSUS CHESTER ROSS
4214-7146-0041 I TRIED TO BE AS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED AS I COULD BE FOR I WANTED MISSUS CHESTER ROSS TO THINK I WAS A LADYLIKE LITTLE GIRL EVEN IF I WASN'T PRETTY EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT UNTIL I SAW MARILLA COMING WITH THE PLUM PUDDING IN ONE HAND AND THE PITCHER OF PUDDING SAUCE WARMED UP IN THE OTHER
4214-7146-0042 DIANA THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING AND I JUST STOOD UP IN MY PLACE AND SHRIEKED OUT MARILLA YOU MUSTN'T USE THAT PUDDING SAUCE THERE WAS A MOUSE DROWNED IN IT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU BEFORE
4214-7146-0043 OH DIANA I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT AWFUL MOMENT IF I LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED MISSUS CHESTER ROSS JUST LOOKED AT ME AND I THOUGHT I WOULD SINK THROUGH THE FLOOR WITH MORTIFICATION
4214-7146-0044 SHE IS SUCH A PERFECT HOUSEKEEPER AND FANCY WHAT SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF US MARILLA TURNED RED AS FIRE BUT SHE NEVER SAID A WORD THEN SHE JUST CARRIED THAT SAUCE AND PUDDING OUT AND BROUGHT IN SOME STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SHE EVEN OFFERED ME SOME
4214-7146-0045 BUT I COULDN'T SWALLOW A MOUTHFUL IT WAS LIKE HEAPING COALS OF FIRE ON MY HEAD AFTER MISSUS CHESTER ROSS WENT AWAY MARILLA GAVE ME A DREADFUL SCOLDING WHY DIANA WHAT IS THE MATTER DIANA HAD STOOD UP VERY UNSTEADILY THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN PUTTING HER HANDS TO HER HEAD
4214-7146-0046 I'M I'M AWFUL SICK SHE SAID A LITTLE THICKLY I I MUST GO RIGHT HOME OH YOU MUSTN'T DREAM OF GOING HOME WITHOUT YOUR TEA CRIED ANNE IN DISTRESS I'LL GET IT RIGHT OFF I'LL GO AND PUT THE TEA DOWN THIS VERY MINUTE

4214-7146-0048 I MUST GO HOME SAID DIANA AND THAT WAS ALL SHE WOULD SAY IN VAIN ANNE PLEADED I NEVER HEARD OF COMPANY GOING HOME WITHOUT TEA SHE MOURNED OH DIANA DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE YOU'RE REALLY TAKING THE SMALLPOX

4214-7146-0050 GOT DIANA'S HAT AND WENT WITH HER AS FAR AS THE BARRY YARD FENCE THEN SHE WEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO GREEN GABLES WHERE SHE SORROWFULLY PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL BACK INTO THE PANTRY AND GOT TEA READY FOR MATTHEW AND JERRY WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE
4214-7146-0051 AND AS THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS FROM DAWN TILL DUSK ANNE DID NOT STIR ABROAD FROM GREEN GABLES MONDAY AFTERNOON MARILLA SENT HER DOWN TO MISSUS LYNDE'S ON AN ERRAND IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ANNE CAME FLYING BACK UP THE LANE WITH TEARS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS
4214-7146-0052 INTO THE KITCHEN SHE DASHED AND FLUNG HERSELF FACE DOWNWARD ON THE SOFA IN AN AGONY WHATEVER HAS GONE WRONG NOW ANNE QUERIED MARILLA IN DOUBT AND DISMAY I DO HOPE YOU HAVEN'T GONE AND BEEN SAUCY TO MISSUS LYNDE AGAIN

4214-7146-0058 ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE STRICTER SORT MISSUS BARRY AMONG THEM DISAPPROVED STRONGLY OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME MARILLA RECOLLECTED THAT SHE HAD PUT THE BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL DOWN IN THE CELLAR
4214-7146-0059 SHE WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN WITH THE WINE BOTTLE IN HER HAND HER FACE WAS TWITCHING IN SPITE OF HERSELF ANNE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A GENIUS FOR GETTING INTO TROUBLE YOU WENT AND GAVE DIANA CURRANT WINE INSTEAD OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL
4214-7146-0060 DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF I NEVER TASTED IT SAID ANNE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CORDIAL I MEANT TO BE SO SO HOSPITABLE DIANA GOT AWFULLY SICK AND HAD TO GO HOME MISSUS BARRY TOLD MISSUS LYNDE SHE WAS SIMPLY DEAD DRUNK

4214-7146-0062 SHE WILL NEVER BELIEVE BUT WHAT I DID IT ON PURPOSE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD BETTER PUNISH DIANA FOR BEING SO GREEDY AS TO DRINK THREE GLASSFULS OF ANYTHING SAID MARILLA SHORTLY WHY THREE OF THOSE BIG GLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE HER SICK EVEN IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN CORDIAL
4214-7146-0063 WELL THIS STORY WILL BE A NICE HANDLE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE SO DOWN ON ME FOR MAKING CURRANT WINE ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T MADE ANY FOR THREE YEARS EVER SINCE I FOUND OUT THAT THE MINISTER DIDN'T APPROVE I JUST KEPT THAT BOTTLE FOR SICKNESS

4214-7146-0066 MY COURAGE FAILS ME AT THE THOUGHT OF FACING DIANA'S INJURED MOTHER SIGHED ANNE I WISH YOU'D GO MARILLA YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE DIGNIFIED THAN I AM LIKELY SHE'D LISTEN TO YOU QUICKER THAN TO ME WELL I WILL
4214-7146-0067 SAID MARILLA REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE WISER COURSE DON'T CRY ANY MORE ANNE IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT MARILLA HAD CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT IT BEING ALL RIGHT BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK FROM ORCHARD SLOPE ANNE WAS WATCHING FOR HER COMING AND FLEW TO THE PORCH DOOR TO MEET HER
4214-7146-0068 OH MARILLA I KNOW BY YOUR FACE THAT IT'S BEEN NO USE SHE SAID SORROWFULLY MISSUS BARRY WON'T FORGIVE ME MISSUS BARRY INDEED SNAPPED MARILLA OF ALL THE UNREASONABLE WOMEN I EVER SAW SHE'S THE WORST
4214-7146-0069 MARILLA WHISKED INTO THE KITCHEN GRIEVOUSLY DISTURBED LEAVING A VERY MUCH DISTRACTED LITTLE SOUL IN THE PORCH BEHIND HER PRESENTLY ANNE STEPPED OUT BAREHEADED INTO THE CHILL AUTUMN DUSK
4214-7146-0070 VERY DETERMINEDLY AND STEADILY SHE TOOK HER WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SERE CLOVER FIELD OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THROUGH THE SPRUCE GROVE LIGHTED BY A PALE LITTLE MOON HANGING LOW OVER THE WESTERN WOODS
4214-7146-0071 MISSUS BARRY COMING TO THE DOOR IN ANSWER TO A TIMID KNOCK FOUND A WHITE LIPPED EAGER EYED SUPPLIANT ON THE DOORSTEP HER FACE HARDENED MISSUS BARRY WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG PREJUDICES AND DISLIKES AND HER ANGER WAS OF THE COLD SULLEN SORT WHICH IS ALWAYS HARDEST TO OVERCOME
4214-7146-0072 TO DO HER JUSTICE SHE REALLY BELIEVED ANNE HAD MADE DIANA DRUNK OUT OF SHEER MALICE PREPENSE AND SHE WAS HONESTLY ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE HER LITTLE DAUGHTER FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF FURTHER INTIMACY WITH SUCH A CHILD WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID STIFFLY
4214-7146-0073 ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS OH MISSUS BARRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME I DID NOT MEAN TO TO INTOXICATE DIANA HOW COULD I JUST IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRL THAT KIND PEOPLE HAD ADOPTED
4214-7146-0074 AND YOU HAD JUST ONE BOSOM FRIEND IN ALL THE WORLD DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD INTOXICATE HER ON PURPOSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY RASPBERRY CORDIAL I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED IT WAS RASPBERRY CORDIAL OH PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT YOU WON'T LET DIANA PLAY WITH ME ANY MORE
4214-7146-0075 IF YOU DO YOU WILL COVER MY LIFE WITH A DARK CLOUD OF WOE THIS SPEECH WHICH WOULD HAVE SOFTENED GOOD MISSUS LYNDE'S HEART IN A TWINKLING HAD NO EFFECT ON MISSUS BARRY EXCEPT TO IRRITATE HER STILL MORE SHE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF ANNE'S BIG WORDS AND DRAMATIC GESTURES
4214-7146-0076 AND IMAGINED THAT THE CHILD WAS MAKING FUN OF HER SO SHE SAID COLDLY AND CRUELLY I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A FIT LITTLE GIRL FOR DIANA TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOU'D BETTER GO HOME AND BEHAVE YOURSELF ANNE'S LIPS QUIVERED
4214-7146-0077 WON'T YOU LET ME SEE DIANA JUST ONCE TO SAY FAREWELL SHE IMPLORED DIANA HAS GONE OVER TO CARMODY WITH HER FATHER SAID MISSUS BARRY GOING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR ANNE WENT BACK TO GREEN GABLES CALM WITH DESPAIR
4214-7146-0078 MY LAST HOPE IS GONE SHE TOLD MARILLA I WENT UP AND SAW MISSUS BARRY MYSELF AND SHE TREATED ME VERY INSULTINGLY MARILLA I DO NOT THINK SHE IS A WELL BRED WOMAN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO DO EXCEPT TO PRAY
4214-7146-0079 ANNE YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SUCH THINGS REBUKED MARILLA STRIVING TO OVERCOME THAT UNHOLY TENDENCY TO LAUGHTER WHICH SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND GROWING UPON HER AND INDEED WHEN SHE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO MATTHEW THAT NIGHT SHE DID LAUGH HEARTILY OVER ANNE'S TRIBULATIONS
4214-7146-0080 BUT WHEN SHE SLIPPED INTO THE EAST GABLE BEFORE GOING TO BED AND FOUND THAT ANNE HAD CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP AN UNACCUSTOMED SOFTNESS CREPT INTO HER FACE POOR LITTLE SOUL SHE MURMURED
