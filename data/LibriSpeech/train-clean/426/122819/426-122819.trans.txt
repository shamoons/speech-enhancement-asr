426-122819-0000 THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
426-122819-0001 TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
426-122819-0002 AND PIPING A QUAINT LITTLE MELODY AMONG THE TWISTED FIRS BELOW THE GARDEN TURNED HER DREAMY FACE OVER HER SHOULDER THE TROUBLE IS YOU AND MISSUS LYNDE DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER SHE EXPLAINED THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT IS WRONG WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
426-122819-0003 I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
426-122819-0004 I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
426-122819-0005 YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
426-122819-0006 I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
426-122819-0007 YOU MUST EXCUSE ME ANNE I'VE GOT A HABIT OF BEING OUTSPOKEN AND FOLKS MUSTN'T MIND IT BUT THEY CAN'T HELP MINDING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP THAT IT'S YOUR HABIT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A PERSON WHO WENT ABOUT STICKING PINS AND NEEDLES INTO PEOPLE AND SAYING
426-122819-0008 EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
426-122819-0009 AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
426-122819-0010 FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
426-122819-0011 MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
426-122819-0012 MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
426-122819-0013 SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
426-122819-0014 THE MAIN QUESTION IS WILL THIS JOSHUA DO HIS WORK WELL IF HE DOES I DON'T SEE THAT IT MATTERS WHETHER HIS NAME IS PYE OR PUDDING HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING A GOOD WORKMAN THOUGH THEY SAY HE'S A VERY PECULIAR MAN HE HARDLY EVER TALKS
426-122819-0015 HE'S PECULIAR ENOUGH ALL RIGHT THEN SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY
426-122819-0016 I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
426-122819-0017 I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
426-122819-0018 THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
426-122819-0019 BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
426-122819-0020 THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
426-122819-0021 THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
426-122819-0022 ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
426-122819-0023 THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
426-122819-0024 IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
426-122819-0025 AND THE MORTON HARRIS PAINT CANS WERE NUMBERED ACCORDING TO A COLOR CARD A PURCHASER CHOSE HIS SHADE ON THE CARD AND ORDERED BY THE ACCOMPANYING NUMBER
426-122819-0026 AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
426-122819-0027 AND THERE THE MATTER STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT NIGHT THERE WAS BLANK DISMAY IN EVERY AVONLEA HOUSE WHERE AN IMPROVER LIVED THE GLOOM AT GREEN GABLES WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT QUENCHED EVEN DAVY ANNE WEPT AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED
426-122819-0028 AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
426-122819-0029 THEIR MONEY HAD GONE TO PAINT THE HALL AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY FELT THEMSELVES BITTERLY AGGRIEVED BY THE MISTAKE PUBLIC INDIGNATION CENTERED ON THE PYES ROGER PYE AND JOHN ANDREW HAD BUNGLED THE MATTER BETWEEN THEM
426-122819-0030 AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
426-122819-0031 YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
426-122819-0032 THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
426-122819-0033 HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
426-122819-0034 TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
426-122819-0035 AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT
426-122819-0036 FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
