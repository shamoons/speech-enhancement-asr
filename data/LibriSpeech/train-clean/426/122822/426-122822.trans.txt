426-122822-0000 A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
426-122822-0001 SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
426-122822-0002 ANTHONY PYE STRUTTED TO HIS WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTINENT SWAGGER AND SHE SAW HIM WHISPER SOMETHING TO HIS SEAT MATE AND THEN GLANCE AT HER WITH A GRIN NEVER SO IT SEEMED TO ANNE HAD THERE BEEN SO MANY SQUEAKY PENCILS AS THERE WERE THAT MORNING
426-122822-0003 AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
426-122822-0004 ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
426-122822-0005 PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
426-122822-0006 TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
426-122822-0007 ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
426-122822-0008 ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
426-122822-0009 REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
426-122822-0010 JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
426-122822-0011 ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
426-122822-0012 WHERE BARBARA SHAW IN AN AGONY OF DESIRE TO BE USEFUL POURED A PAILFUL OF HALF FROZEN WATER OVER PRILLIE'S FACE AND SHOULDERS BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HER IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE QUIET WAS RESTORED
426-122822-0013 EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
426-122822-0014 CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
426-122822-0015 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
426-122822-0016 HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
426-122822-0017 ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
426-122822-0018 HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
426-122822-0019 ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
426-122822-0020 ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
426-122822-0021 EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
426-122822-0022 SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
426-122822-0023 KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
426-122822-0024 THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
426-122822-0025 IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
426-122822-0026 OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
426-122822-0027 WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU

426-122822-0030 IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
426-122822-0031 EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
426-122822-0032 ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
426-122822-0033 BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
426-122822-0034 MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
426-122822-0035 NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
