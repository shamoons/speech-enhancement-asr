4267-287369-0000 RATHER ODD COMMENTED MISTER JENKS BLACK PAPER AND WHITE INK WHITE INK IS EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE STATED MISTER PARKER
4267-287369-0001 I FANCY THEY WANTED IT AS CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE YES AGREED TOM
4267-287369-0002 TOGETHER WITH THE ANTICS OF THE THING IN WHITE LAST NIGHT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF OUR PRESENCE HERE AND PERHAPS KNOW WHO WE ARE WE WILL HAVE TO BE ON OUR GUARD DO YOU THINK THAT FELLOW MUNSON
4267-287369-0003 WHOM WE LEFT IN THE FOREST COULD HAVE GOTTEN HERE AND WARNED THEM ASKED MISTER DAMON IT'S POSSIBLE ADMITTED TOM BUT NOW LET'S SEE IF THE PERSON WHO PINNED THIS WARNING ON OUR TENT TOOK ANY OF OUR THINGS
4267-287369-0004 A HASTY EXAMINATION HOWEVER SHOWED THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN DISTURBED
4267-287369-0005 EVERYONE TALKING DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE MEAL ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AND THE RATHER WEIRD CULMINATION OF IT WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS SO FAR ADMITTED TOM
4267-287369-0006 GOOD IDEA COMMENTED MISTER JENKS WE'LL DO IT AND MOVE OUR CAMP I ONLY HOPE THOSE FELLOWS DON'T FIND OUR AIRSHIP AND DESTROY IT WE'LL HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION AGAIN
4267-287369-0007 IF WE HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY THIS CONTINGENCY CAUSED TOM SOME UNEASINESS HE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK THAT THE UNSCRUPULOUS MEN MIGHT DAMAGE THE RED CLOUD
4267-287369-0008 THAT HAD BEEN BUILT ONLY AFTER HARD LABOR BUT HE KNEW HE COULD ACCOMPLISH NOTHING BY WORRYING AND HE TRIED TO DISMISS THE MATTER FROM HIS MIND
4267-287369-0009 THEY RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING IN WHITE AGAIN THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR AND MORNING CAME WITHOUT ANYTHING HAVING DISTURBED THEIR HEAVY SLEEP FOR THEY WERE TIRED FROM THE DAY'S TRAMP
4267-287369-0010 IT TOOK THEM THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY TO MAKE A CIRCUIT OF THE BASE OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN IN ORDER TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE A SORT OF TRAIL LED UPWARD IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING TO NIGHT
4267-287369-0011 MISTER PARKER HE ASKED AS HE SAW THE SCIENTIST TRAMPING A LITTLE WAY UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN I AM GOING TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO HIM FOR SOME TIME
4267-287369-0012 SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY WHEN MISTER PARKER RETURNED HIS FACE WORE A RATHER SERIOUS AIR AND MISTER DAMON NOTING IT ASKED LAUGHINGLY WELL
4267-287369-0013 DID YOU DISCOVER ANY VOLCANOES THAT MAY ERUPT DURING THE NIGHT AND SCARE US TO DEATH NO REPLIED MISTER PARKER CALMLY BUT THERE IS EVERY INDICATION THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A TERRIFIC ELECTRICAL STORM
4267-287369-0014 FROM A HIGH PEAK I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE WORKING THIS WAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS THEN WE'D BETTER FASTEN THE TENT WELL DOWN CALLED TOM WE DON'T WANT IT TO BLOW AWAY
4267-287369-0015 WAS MISTER PARKER'S OPINION FROM WHAT THEN ASKED MISTER JENKS FROM THE DISCHARGES OF LIGHTNING AMONG THESE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH CONTAIN SO MUCH IRON ORE
4267-287369-0016 WE WILL BE IN GRAVE DANGER THE FACT THAT THE SCIENTIST HAD NOT ALWAYS MADE CORRECT PREDICTIONS WAS NOT NOW CONSIDERED BY HIS HEARERS AND TOM AND THE TWO MEN GAZED AT MISTER PARKER IN SOME ALARM
4267-287369-0017 AS THE IRON ORE EXTENDS FOR MILES WE CAN NOT GET OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE BEFORE THE STORM WILL REACH US IT WILL BE HERE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEN WE'D BETTER HAVE SUPPER REMARKED TOM PRACTICALLY
4267-287369-0018 AND GET READY FOR IT PERHAPS IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS MISTER PARKER FEARS IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH DECLARED THE GLOOMY SCIENTIST AND HE SEEMED TO FIND PLEASURE IN HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
4267-287369-0019 FOR NOW LOW MUTTERINGS OF THUNDER COULD BE HEARD OFF TOWARD THE WEST BLACK CLOUDS RAPIDLY OBSCURED THE HEAVENS AND THE SOUND OF THUNDER INCREASED
4267-287369-0020 FITFUL FLASHES OF LIGHTNING COULD BE SEEN FORKING ACROSS THE SKY IN JAGGED CHAINS OF PURPLE LIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE A HEAVY STORM TOM ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
4267-287369-0021 I HOPE LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE AROUND HERE THE STORM CAME ON RAPIDLY BUT THERE WAS A CURIOUS QUIETNESS IN THE AIR THAT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN IF A WIND HAD BLOWN THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY
4267-287369-0022 AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN OPPRESSIVENESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK SAVE WHEN THE FITFUL LIGHTNING FLASHES CAME AND THEY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE BRILLIANTLY FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN BY CONTRAST
4267-287369-0023 IT WAS BLACKER THAN EVER SUDDENLY AS TOM WAS GAZING UP TOWARD THE PEAK OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HE SAW SOMETHING THAT CAUSED HIM TO CRY OUT IN ALARM HE POINTED UPWARD AND WHISPERED HOARSELY
4267-287369-0024 THEY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US SAID MISTER JENKS IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY THE FIGURE ADVANCED IT WAVED THE LONG WHITE ARMS AS IF IN WARNING
4267-287369-0025 AT TIMES IT WOULD BE ONLY DIMLY VISIBLE IN THE BLACKNESS THEN SUDDENLY IT WOULD STAND OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AS A GREAT FLASH OF FIRE SPLIT THE CLOUDS THE THUNDER MEANWHILE
4267-287369-0026 HAD BEEN GROWING LOUDER AND SHARPER INDICATING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THE STORM EACH LIGHTNING FLASH WAS FOLLOWED IN A SECOND OR TWO BY A TERRIFIC CLAP STILL THERE WAS NO WIND NOR RAIN
4267-287369-0027 AND THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRASH AS IF THE VERY MOUNTAIN HAD SPLIT ASUNDER AND THE ADVENTURERS SAW A GREAT BALL OF PURPLE BLUISH FIRE SHOOT DOWN
4267-287369-0028 AS IF FROM SOME CLOUD AND STRIKE AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CRAG NOT A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE STOOD THE GHOSTLY FIGURE IN WHITE THAT WAS A BAD ONE CRIED MISTER DAMON
4267-287369-0029 SHOUTING SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ECHOES OF THE THUNDERCLAP ALMOST AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME ANOTHER EXPLOSION EVEN LOUDER THAN THE ONE PRECEDING A GREAT BALL OF FIRE PEAR SHAPED
4267-287369-0030 LEAPED FOR THE SAME SPOT IN THE MOUNTAIN THERE'S A MASS OF IRON ORE THERE YELLED MISTER PARKER THE LIGHTNING IS ATTRACTED TO IT HIS VOICE WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TERRIFIC CRASH THAT FOLLOWED
4267-287369-0031 THE FIGURE IN WHITE COULD BE SEEN HURRYING BACK UP THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL EVIDENTLY THE ELECTRICAL STORM WITH LIGHTNING BOLTS DISCHARGING SO CLOSE WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE GHOST
4267-287369-0032 IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE PLACE ABOUT WHERE THE DIAMOND SEEKERS STOOD WAS A MASS OF FIRE GREAT FORKED TONGUES OF LIGHTNING LEAPED FROM THE CLOUDS AND SEEMED TO LICK THE GROUND
4267-287369-0033 AND THERE WAS A STRONG SMELL OF SULPHUR IN THE AIR WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE STORM CRIED MISTER PARKER WE ARE STANDING ON A MASS OF IRON ORE ANY MINUTE MAY BE OUR LAST
4267-287369-0034 BUT FATE HAD NOT INTENDED THE ADVENTURERS FOR DEATH BY LIGHTNING ALMOST AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD BEGUN THE DISCHARGE OF THE TONGUES OF FIRE CEASED IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF OUR FRIENDS
4267-287369-0035 THEY STOOD STILL AWED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THEN ONCE MORE CAME A TERRIFIC CLAP A GREAT MASS OF FIRE LIKE SOME RED HOT INGOT FROM A FOUNDRY
4267-287369-0036 WAS HURLED THROUGH THE AIR STRAIGHT AT THE FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AT THE SPOT WHERE THE FIGURE IN WHITE HAD STOOD BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AS IT HAD AT EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
4267-287369-0037 BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME IT WAS OVER IN A FEW SECONDS THEN AS THE DIAMOND SEEKERS LOOKED THEY SAW IN THE GLARE OF A SCORE OF LIGHTNING FLASHES THAT FOLLOWED THE ONE GREAT CLAP
