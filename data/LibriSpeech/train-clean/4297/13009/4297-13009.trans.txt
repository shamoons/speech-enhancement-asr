4297-13009-0000 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0001 BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
4297-13009-0002 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0003 AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
4297-13009-0004 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0005 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0006 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0008 IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
4297-13009-0010 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0011 THEY ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO EACH OTHER AND NOW I HEAR THEY PASS THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE STEPS OF THE CARLTON AND REFORM CLUBS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO ONE MUST BE PATRONAGE SECRETARY NO DOUBT THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN IN THEIR WAY YOU KNOW
4297-13009-0012 BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0014 WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
4297-13009-0015 BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
4297-13009-0016 SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
4297-13009-0017 SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
4297-13009-0018 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0020 THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
4297-13009-0021 WHEN IT WAS FIRST KNOWN THAT THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAD CONSENTED TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT THEY HAD BOTH ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER BEEN LOUD IN HIS PRAISE GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD DO THE WORK
4297-13009-0022 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0023 AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
4297-13009-0024 AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
4297-13009-0025 SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
4297-13009-0026 THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
4297-13009-0027 WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
4297-13009-0028 THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
4297-13009-0029 AND SO I TOLD THE DUKE HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR MEN I THINK HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID ROBY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FAIR DIVISION INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONTENT BUT THE PARTY WOULD BE DISSATISFIED
4297-13009-0030 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
4297-13009-0031 OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
4297-13009-0032 A MEANING TO A MAN'S WORDS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH ANOTHER TONE WOULD CONVEY OR IF HE DOES LIE IN DOING SO HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE LIES MISTER RATTLER HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD OFFICE AT THE TREASURY
4297-13009-0033 AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
4297-13009-0034 MANY OF THE CARES OF OFFICE THE PRIME MINISTER DID SUCCEED IN SHUFFLING OFF ALTOGETHER ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF HIS ELDER FRIEND HE WOULD NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF LADIES ABOUT WHOM HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING
4297-13009-0035 AND AS TO WHOSE FITNESS AND CLAIMS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TO BE AS IGNORANT AS THE OFFICE MESSENGER THE OFFERS WERE OF COURSE MADE IN THE USUAL FORM AS THOUGH COMING DIRECT FROM THE QUEEN THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER BUT THE SELECTIONS WERE IN TRUTH EFFECTED BY THE OLD DUKE IN COUNCIL WITH
4297-13009-0036 AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
4297-13009-0037 THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
4297-13009-0038 SHE BROODED OVER HER INJURY AND HIS HEART WAS SAD WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD VEXED HER LOVING HER AS HE DID WITH ALL HIS HEART BUT WITH A HEART THAT WAS NEVER DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY HE WAS MISERABLE
4297-13009-0039 THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
4297-13009-0040 OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
4297-13009-0041 HE HAD EXPRESSLY ASKED HER FOR HER SYMPATHY IN THE BUSINESS HE HAD ON HAND THEREBY GOING MUCH BEYOND HIS USUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER
4297-13009-0042 HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0043 IS TO BE MISTRESS OF THE ROBES HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY HE HAD GONE TO HER UP TO HER OWN ROOM BEFORE HE DRESSED FOR DINNER HAVING DEVOTED MUCH MORE TIME THAN AS PRIME MINISTER HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE TO A RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT WITH HER AND TO THE BEST WAY OF DOING IT
4297-13009-0044 SO I AM TOLD SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE PLACE AS I REMEMBER SHE WAS AT THE SAME WORK WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF ELEVEN THAT'S NOT SO VERY LONG AGO CORA SILVERBRIDGE IS OLDER NOW THAN I WAS THEN
4297-13009-0045 AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO LORD SILVERBRIDGE WAS THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE BEGAN HER CAREER IN THE TIME OF GEORGE THE FOURTH WHAT IS IT TO YOU
4297-13009-0046 IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
4297-13009-0047 THAT IT WON'T COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY OFFICE TO EFFECT OR EVEN TO PROPOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN HER GRACE'S APPAREL BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU AND I CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHE MAY BE AN ANTIQUATED EVE FOR ME
4297-13009-0048 I HOPE CORA YOU ARE NOT STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF NOT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT THINK ME FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH ANY JUDGMENT OF MY OWN
4297-13009-0049 AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
4297-13009-0050 YOU WILL I AM SURE SAY NOTHING UNKIND TO A LADY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE PLACE SHE NOW FILLS BY MY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT LET US QUARREL ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN I WON'T QUARREL WITH YOU EVEN ABOUT A YOUNG ONE
4297-13009-0051 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
4297-13009-0052 THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
4297-13009-0053 MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
4297-13009-0054 YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT
4297-13009-0055 THE ONE MAN IN PARLIAMENT MODEST ENOUGH NOT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE FIT FOR ANY PLACE THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO HIM POOR BARRINGTON HE DOES NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO OFTEN I QUITE SYMPATHISE WITH HIM AND SO PHINEAS IS TO BE SECRETARY FOR IRELAND
4297-13009-0056 NOT IN THE CABINET NO NOT IN THE CABINET IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS USUAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT IS PROMOTION AND I AM GLAD POOR PHINEAS I HOPE THEY WON'T MURDER HIM OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
4297-13009-0057 THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
4297-13009-0058 OVER THERE HE COMES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS EVERY WEEK DOESN'T HE NOT QUITE THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL MISS HER IF SHE HAS TO STAY AWAY LONG I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE HER I DO LIKE HER
4297-13009-0059 SHE HAS ALWAYS BEHAVED WELL BOTH TO ME AND TO MY UNCLE SHE WAS AN ANGEL TO HIM
4297-13009-0060 THIS SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH NOT MEANING IT ALTOGETHER BUT YET HALF MEANING IT I HAVE ASKED HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE OFFICE SAID THE DUKE SOLEMNLY BECAUSE I AM TOLD THAT HE IS FIT FOR IT
4297-13009-0061 BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0062 BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
4297-13009-0063 AND THAT SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION FOR WHICH HE HAD FIRST ASKED WAS ACCORDED TO HIM IT MAY BE A QUESTION WHETHER ON THE WHOLE THE DUCHESS DID NOT WORK HARDER THAN HE DID
4297-13009-0064 IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
4297-13009-0065 TO WHICH HE OBJECTED ONLY ON THE SCORE OF TIME YOU MUST EAT YOUR DINNER SOMEWHERE SHE SAID AND YOU NEED ONLY COME IN JUST BEFORE WE SIT DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR OWN ROOM IF YOU PLEASE WITHOUT COMING UPSTAIRS AT ALL I CAN AT ANY RATE DO THAT PART OF IT FOR YOU
