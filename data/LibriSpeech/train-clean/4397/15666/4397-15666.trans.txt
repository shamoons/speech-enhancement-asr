4397-15666-0000 THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
4397-15666-0001 ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
4397-15666-0002 WIND RAIN AND SNOW FILLED THE WHOLE BASIN DRIVING WILDLY OVER VALLEY AND PLAIN FROM RANGE TO RANGE BESTOWING THEIR BENEFACTIONS IN MOST CORDIAL AND HARMONIOUS STORM MEASURES
4397-15666-0003 WITH BILLOWS OF DUST AND SAND
4397-15666-0004 THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
4397-15666-0005 POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
4397-15666-0006 WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
4397-15666-0007 AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
4397-15666-0008 TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
4397-15666-0009 WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
4397-15666-0010 A DARK BROWNISH CLOUD APPEARED CLOSE DOWN ON THE PLAIN TOWARDS THE LAKE EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ITS PECULIAR COLOR AND STRUCTURE
4397-15666-0011 EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
4397-15666-0012 ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
4397-15666-0013 AND UP THE SLOPES OF THE WAHSATCH ECLIPSING ALL THE LANDSCAPES IN ITS COURSE THE BENDING TREES THE DUST STREAMERS AND THE WILD ONRUSH OF EVERYTHING MOVABLE GIVING IT AN APPRECIABLE VISIBILITY THAT RENDERED IT GRAND AND INSPIRING
4397-15666-0014 THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15666-0015 MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
4397-15666-0016 EVEN ROSES AND LILIES IN GARDENS MOST LOVED ARE TAINTED WITH A THOUSAND IMPURITIES AS SOON AS THEY UNFOLD I HEARD BRIGHAM YOUNG IN THE TABERNACLE THE OTHER DAY WARNING HIS PEOPLE THAT IF THEY DID NOT MEND THEIR MANNERS ANGELS WOULD NOT COME INTO THEIR HOUSES
4397-15666-0017 THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
4397-15666-0018 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
4397-15666-0019 TOWARD THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH IT BEGAN TO WITHER THE SNOWY SKIRTS OF THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS APPEARED BENEATH THE LIFTING FRINGES OF THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN SHONE OUT THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS PRODUCING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS AFTER STORM EFFECTS I EVER WITNESSED
4397-15666-0020 LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
4397-15666-0021 SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
4397-15666-0022 EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
4397-15666-0023 BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
4397-15666-0024 TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
4397-15666-0025 THEY ARE COVERED WITH COMMON SUNSHINE DOWN HERE ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN LARKS AND REDWINGS ARE SWINGING ON THE RUSHES THE BALMY AIR IS INSTINCT WITH IMMORTAL LIFE THE WILD FLOWERS THE GRASS
4397-15666-0026 AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
