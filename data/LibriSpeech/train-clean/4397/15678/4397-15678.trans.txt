4397-15678-0001 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0003 HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006 AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0007 NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0009 AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0010 AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011 HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0012 AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0015 PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017 AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0018 OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0021 A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
4397-15678-0022 WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0024 THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0025 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0027 SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
4397-15678-0028 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032 ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0033 PILLARS OF VERDURE IN REGULAR ROWS SEVEN FEET APART AND EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT THE LONG VIGOROUS SHOOTS SWEEPING ROUND IN FINE WILD FREEDOM AND THE LIGHT LEAFY CONES HANGING IN LOOSE HANDSOME CLUSTERS PERHAPS ENOUGH OF HOPS
4397-15678-0034 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036 BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0037 AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039 SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0040 THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041 AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0042 WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
