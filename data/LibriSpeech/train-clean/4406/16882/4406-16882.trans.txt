4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0001 BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
4406-16882-0002 IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
4406-16882-0003 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0004 STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
4406-16882-0005 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0006 I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
4406-16882-0007 OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16882-0008 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0010 I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
4406-16882-0011 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
4406-16882-0013 I ASKED THEM WHETHER I MIGHT NOT LODGE IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED WHAT WILL YOU LOVE ENGLISH MEN STILL THIS WAS THE DOLEFULEST NIGHT THAT EVER MY EYES SAW OH THE ROARING AND SINGING AND DANCING AND YELLING OF THOSE BLACK CREATURES IN THE NIGHT
4406-16882-0014 SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
4406-16882-0015 AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
4406-16882-0016 MY CHILDREN GONE MY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS GONE OUR HOUSE AND HOME AND ALL OUR COMFORTS WITHIN DOOR AND WITHOUT ALL WAS GONE EXCEPT MY LIFE AND I KNEW NOT BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THAT MIGHT GO TOO THERE REMAINED NOTHING TO ME BUT ONE POOR WOUNDED BABE
4406-16882-0017 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
4406-16882-0018 BY ONE EYED JOHN AND MARLBOROUGH'S PRAYING INDIANS WHICH CAPTAIN MOSELY BROUGHT TO BOSTON AS THE INDIANS TOLD ME THE SECOND REMOVE BUT NOW THE NEXT MORNING I MUST TURN MY BACK UPON THE TOWN AND TRAVEL WITH THEM INTO THE VAST AND DESOLATE WILDERNESS
4406-16882-0019 I KNEW NOT WHITHER IT IS NOT MY TONGUE OR PEN CAN EXPRESS THE SORROWS OF MY HEART AND BITTERNESS OF MY SPIRIT THAT I HAD AT THIS DEPARTURE BUT GOD WAS WITH ME IN A WONDERFUL MANNER CARRYING ME ALONG AND BEARING UP MY SPIRIT
4406-16882-0020 THAT IT DID NOT QUITE FAIL ONE OF THE INDIANS CARRIED MY POOR WOUNDED BABE UPON A HORSE IT WENT MOANING ALL ALONG I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I WENT ON FOOT AFTER IT WITH SORROW THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AT LENGTH I TOOK IT OFF THE HORSE
4406-16882-0021 AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
4406-16882-0022 AT WHICH THEY LIKE INHUMANE CREATURES LAUGHED AND REJOICED TO SEE IT THOUGH I THOUGHT WE SHOULD THERE HAVE ENDED OUR DAYS AS OVERCOME WITH SO MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE LORD RENEWED MY STRENGTH STILL AND CARRIED ME ALONG THAT I MIGHT SEE MORE OF HIS POWER
4406-16882-0023 BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
4406-16882-0024 MY OWN WOUND ALSO GROWING SO STIFF THAT I COULD SCARCE SIT DOWN OR RISE UP YET SO IT MUST BE THAT I MUST SIT ALL THIS COLD WINTER NIGHT UPON THE COLD SNOWY GROUND WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY ARMS
4406-16882-0025 AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE

4406-16882-0032 WHEN I CAME I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UPON THE HILL
4406-16882-0033 AND THERE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD BURIED IT
4406-16882-0034 GOD HAVING TAKEN AWAY THIS DEAR CHILD I WENT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER MARY WHO WAS AT THIS SAME INDIAN TOWN AT A WIGWAM NOT VERY FAR OFF

4406-16882-0036 AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
4406-16882-0037 AND AS I WAS GOING ALONG MY HEART WAS EVEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MY CONDITION AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND A NATION WHICH I KNEW NOT RULED OVER THEM WHEREUPON I EARNESTLY ENTREATED THE LORD THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER MY LOW ESTATE AND SHOW ME A TOKEN FOR GOOD AND IF IT WERE HIS BLESSED WILL
4406-16882-0038 I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
4406-16882-0039 AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
4406-16882-0040 ALL THE COMPANY FOR THOSE THAT BELONGED TO THE OTHER SMALL COMPANY CAME THROUGH THE TOWN THAT NOW WE WERE AT BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO US OH THE OUTRAGEOUS ROARING AND HOOPING THAT THERE WAS THEY BEGAN THEIR DIN ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THEY CAME TO US
4406-16882-0041 BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
4406-16882-0042 AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
4406-16882-0043 I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE WONDERFUL MERCY OF GOD TO ME IN THOSE AFFLICTIONS IN SENDING ME A BIBLE ONE OF THE INDIANS THAT CAME FROM MEDFIELD FIGHT HAD BROUGHT SOME PLUNDER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE A BIBLE HE HAD GOT ONE IN HIS BASKET
4406-16882-0044 AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW

4406-16882-0046 THEY BEING TO GO ONE WAY AND I ANOTHER I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WERE EARNEST WITH GOD FOR DELIVERANCE THEY TOLD ME THEY DID AS THEY WERE ABLE AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO ME THAT THE LORD STIRRED UP CHILDREN TO LOOK TO HIM
4406-16882-0047 I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
4406-16882-0048 AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ

4406-16882-0050 SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
4406-16882-0051 AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED THEY KNOCKED HER ON HEAD AND THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY MADE A FIRE AND PUT THEM BOTH INTO IT
4406-16882-0052 THE CHILDREN SAID SHE DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT PRAYED ALL THE WHILE
4406-16882-0053 WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
4406-16882-0054 THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
4406-16882-0055 AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
4406-16882-0056 SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
4406-16882-0057 UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
4406-16882-0058 AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
4406-16882-0059 BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
4406-16882-0060 WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
4406-16882-0061 THE FIRST WEEK OF MY BEING AMONG THEM I HARDLY ATE ANY THING THE SECOND WEEK I FOUND MY STOMACH GROW VERY FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMETHING AND YET IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET DOWN THEIR FILTHY TRASH BUT THE THIRD WEEK
4406-16882-0062 I TOLD THEM IT WAS THE SABBATH DAY AND DESIRED THEM TO LET ME REST AND TOLD THEM I WOULD DO AS MUCH MORE TOMORROW TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD BREAK MY FACE AND HERE I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE STRANGE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN PRESERVING THE HEATHEN
4406-16882-0063 THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
4406-16882-0064 IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
4406-16882-0065 THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
4406-16882-0066 WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
4406-16882-0067 THOUGH THERE WERE NONE BUT OUR OWN COMPANY THE INDIANS WERE AS THICK AS THE TREES IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A THOUSAND HATCHETS GOING AT ONCE IF ONE LOOKED BEFORE ONE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INDIANS AND BEHIND ONE NOTHING BUT INDIANS
4406-16882-0068 AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
