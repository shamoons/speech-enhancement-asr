4441-76262-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A SOUL OVERBOARD
4441-76262-0001 SOMEBODY HAD CALLED HIS NAME HE SAT UP IN BED AND LISTENED THERE WAS NOT A SOUND HE DREW UP THE BLIND AND LOOKED OUT ON A GREY AUTUMN MORNING WINDY AND RAINY HE WENT BACK TO BED AND TRIED TO SLEEP BUT IN VAIN
4441-76262-0002 THERE WERE STRANGE VOICES IN THE WIND THEY MOANED AND WARNED AND WEPT AND WHIMPERED HE TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING PLEASANT OF HIS HAPPINESS HE TOOK HIS PART AND BEGAN TO LEARN IT IT SEEMED TO BE NOTHING BUT YES MY PRINCE
4441-76262-0003 HE TRIED TO PICTURE HIMSELF ON THE STAGE AS HORATIO HE TRIED TO PICTURE AGNES IN THE PART OF OPHELIA
4441-76262-0004 SPREADING NETS FOR HAMLET AT POLONIUS'S ADVICE HE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY THE THOUGHT AND INSTEAD OF AGNES HE SAW THE COQUETTISH MISS JACQUETTE WHO HAD BEEN THE LAST TO PLAY THE PART AT THE MUNICIPAL THEATRE
4441-76262-0005 HE TRIED IN VAIN TO DRIVE AWAY THESE DISAGREEABLE FANCIES THEY FOLLOWED HIM LIKE GNATS AT LAST EXHAUSTED WITH THE STRAIN HE FELL ASLEEP BUT ONLY TO SUFFER THE SAME TORMENT IN HIS DREAM HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT BUT SOON DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP AGAIN
4441-76262-0006 HE DRESSED HASTILY AND AS HE PICKED UP HIS BOOT A BIG SPIDER RAN ACROSS THE FLOOR THE SIGHT PLEASED HIM FOR HE BELIEVED IN THE SUPERSTITION THAT A SPIDER IS A HARBINGER OF HAPPINESS
4441-76262-0007 HE COULD NOT TELL WHY BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE SPIDER AND CALMLY OPENED THE DOOR A SERVANT HANDED HIM A LETTER FROM FALANDER BEGGING HIM TO COME TO HIS ROOMS AT TEN ON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS AGAIN HE WAS ASSAILED BY THE INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF FEAR
4441-76262-0008 WHICH HAD TROUBLED HIS MORNING SLUMBER HE TRIED TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME UNTIL TEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE DRESSED AND WENT TO FALANDER'S HOUSE THE LATTER HAD RISEN EARLY HIS ROOM HAD BEEN PUT STRAIGHT AND HE WAS READY TO RECEIVE HIS FRIEND
4441-76262-0009 HE GREETED REHNHJELM CORDIALLY BUT WITH UNUSUAL GRAVITY REHNHJELM OVERWHELMED HIM WITH QUESTIONS BUT FALANDER REFUSED TO REPLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK REHNHJELM'S ANXIETY GREW AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS UNPLEASANT NEWS
4441-76262-0010 AND HE DECLARED THAT MANY SO CALLED UNBEARABLE SITUATIONS COULD BE BORNE QUITE EASILY IF ONLY ONE DID NOT EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE THE TIME PASSED SLOWLY BUT AT LAST IT STRUCK TEN A GENTLE DOUBLE RAP AT THE DOOR RELIEVED THE TENSION
4441-76262-0011 FALANDER OPENED AT ONCE AND ADMITTED AGNES WITHOUT A LOOK AT THOSE PRESENT SHE DREW THE KEY FROM THE LOCK AND LOCKED THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE A MOMENTARY EMBARRASSMENT SEIZED HER WHEN ON TURNING ROUND SHE WAS CONFRONTED BY TWO MEN INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE
4441-76262-0012 BUT HER EMBARRASSMENT GAVE WAY TO PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED REHNHJELM THROWING OFF HER WATER PROOF SHE RAN TOWARDS HIM

4441-76262-0014 THE LATTER STOOD QUIETLY LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION BUT HIS FACE WAS DEADLY WHITE AND HE SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THOUGHT HOW WORN YOU ARE LOOKING SAID AGNES CROSSING THE ROOM WITH THE GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS OF A KITTEN AS REHNHJELM RELEASED HER FROM HIS ARMS
4441-76262-0015 FALANDER MADE NO REPLY AGNES LOOKED AT HIM MORE KEENLY
