446-123501-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
446-123501-0001 I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
446-123501-0002 NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
446-123501-0003 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0004 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
446-123501-0005 ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
446-123501-0006 FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
446-123501-0007 NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
446-123501-0008 AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
446-123501-0009 MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
446-123501-0010 MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
446-123501-0011 I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
446-123501-0012 IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
446-123501-0013 AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
446-123501-0014 AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
446-123501-0015 AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
446-123501-0016 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
446-123501-0017 THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
446-123501-0018 THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
446-123501-0019 THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
446-123501-0020 MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
446-123501-0021 ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
446-123501-0022 AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
446-123501-0023 AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
446-123501-0024 OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
446-123501-0025 WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
446-123501-0026 HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0027 HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0028 HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
446-123501-0029 STRAIGHT OUT BEHIND WHILE RUNNING A GAPING MOUTH WHICH SPLIT ITS HEAD FROM ITS SNOUT TO ITS LONG MASSIVE NECK LIKE ITS MASTER IT WAS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF HAIR
446-123501-0030 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
446-123501-0031 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0032 AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
446-123501-0033 TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
446-123501-0034 AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
446-123501-0035 AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
446-123501-0036 OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
446-123501-0037 MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
446-123501-0038 FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
446-123501-0039 SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
446-123501-0040 THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
446-123501-0041 TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
446-123501-0042 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0043 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
446-123501-0044 WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0047 WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
446-123501-0048 AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
446-123501-0049 WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
446-123501-0050 AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
446-123501-0051 WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0053 I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
446-123501-0054 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0056 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
446-123501-0057 SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0058 AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
446-123501-0059 EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
446-123501-0060 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
