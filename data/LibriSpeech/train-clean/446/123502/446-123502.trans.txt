446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0001 MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0004 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0013 AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0019 GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0022 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0028 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0031 IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0034 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0037 WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0040 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0043 TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
