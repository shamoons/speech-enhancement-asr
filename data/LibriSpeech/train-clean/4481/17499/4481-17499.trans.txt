4481-17499-0007 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY SHE'S ENGAGED ASKED MISTER MERRICK AGHAST ONLY FOR THE PARTIES AND RECEPTIONS UNCLE BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF SHE WAS MARRIED SOON SHE'S OLDER THAN BETH OR ME AND HAS A HOST OF ADMIRERS

4481-17499-0009 YOU AND BETH SHALL GO ANYHOW AND WE'LL BRING LOUISE A WEDDING PRESENT WITH THIS DECLARATION HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WALKING STICK AND STARTED FOR THE TELEGRAPH STATION LEAVING PATSY AND HER FATHER TO CANVASS THE UNEXPECTED SITUATION
4481-17499-0010 JOHN MERRICK WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD BUT AS HALE AND RUGGED AS A BOY OF TWENTY HE HAD MADE HIS VAST FORTUNE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
4481-17499-0011 WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
4481-17499-0012 AND EMPLOY HIS AMPLE WEALTH TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE FOR A TIME KEPT HIS SUCCESS A SECRET AND SO LEARNED MUCH OF THE DISPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS THREE NIECES THEY WERE AT THAT TIME VISITING HIS UNMARRIED SISTER JANE AT HER ESTATE AT ELMHURST
4481-17499-0013 AND IN THE RACE FOR AUNT JANE'S FORTUNE HE WATCHED THE THREE GIRLS CAREFULLY AND FOUND MUCH TO ADMIRE IN EACH ONE OF THEM PATSY DOYLE HOWEVER PROVED EXCEPTIONALLY FRANK AND GENUINE
4481-17499-0014 PATSY PROVED THE ONE BRIGHT STAR IN THE FIRMAMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT SUPPOSING UNCLE JOHN TO BE POOR SHE INSISTED UPON CARRYING HIM TO NEW YORK WITH HER AND SHARING WITH HIM THE HUMBLE TENEMENT ROOM IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH HER FATHER A RETIRED VETERAN WHO HELPED PAY THE FAMILY EXPENSES
4481-17499-0015 BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
4481-17499-0016 ELIZABETH DE GRAF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A MUSIC TEACHER IN CLOVERTON OHIO WHILE LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER WIDOWED MOTHER IN A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SECOND CLASS IN NEW YORK
4481-17499-0017 WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
4481-17499-0018 WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
4481-17499-0019 HE SETTLED THE INCOMES OF SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY UPON BOTH BETH AND LOUISE MAKING THEM PRACTICALLY INDEPENDENT FOR PATSY HE BOUGHT A HANDSOME MODERN FLAT BUILDING LOCATED AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE
4481-17499-0020 AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
4481-17499-0021 AND IT REQUIRED NO SHREWD GUESSING TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LITTLE PATSY WAS DESTINED TO INHERIT SOME DAY ALL HIS MILLIONS
4481-17499-0022 HAD LONG MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY JOHN MERRICK'S VAST FORTUNE AND AT HIS SOLICITATION IT GAVE MAJOR DOYLE A RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN ITS MAIN OFFICE WITH A SALARY THAT RENDERED HIM INDEPENDENT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDENLY ACQUIRED WEALTH AND MADE HIM PROUD AND SELF RESPECTING
4481-17499-0023 MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
4481-17499-0024 AND PATSY'S BRIGHT AND SUNNY DISPOSITION HAD CERTAIN POWER TO CHEER ANY HOME WHETHER LOCATED IN A PALACE OR A HOVEL NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD UNCLE JOHN BEEN SO SUPREMELY HAPPY
4481-17499-0025 AND NEVER BEFORE HAD AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES HAD SO MANY ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES IT WAS TO CONFER STILL FURTHER BENEFITS UPON THESE GIRLS THAT THEIR ECCENTRIC UNCLE HAD PLANNED THIS UNEXPECTED EUROPEAN TRIP HIS TELEGRAM TO ELIZABETH WAS CHARACTERISTIC
4481-17499-0026 PATSY LOUISE AND I SAIL FOR EUROPE NEXT TUESDAY WILL YOU JOIN US AS MY GUEST IF SO TAKE FIRST TRAIN TO NEW YORK WHERE I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR OUTFIT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS A MESSAGE LIKELY TO SURPRISE A COUNTRY GIRL
4481-17499-0027 BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
4481-17499-0028 PATSY REMINDED HIM THAT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN TOWN HE MUST PERSONALLY NOTIFY LOUISE MERRICK OF THE PROPOSED TRIP SO HE TOOK A CROSS TOWN LINE AND ARRIVED AT THE MERRICK'S HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK MISSUS MERRICK WAS IN A MORNING WRAPPER
4481-17499-0029 SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
4481-17499-0030 LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
4481-17499-0031 AND THE DEAR CHILD WAS AT THE OPERA LAST NIGHT WHICH MADE HER LATE IN GETTING HOME DOESN'T THE OPERA LET OUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE SAME AS THE THEATRES HE ASKED I BELIEVE SO BUT THERE IS THE SUPPER AFTERWARD YOU KNOW
4481-17499-0032 AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
4481-17499-0033 BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
4481-17499-0034 AND COULD MAKE NO BETTER REPLY THAN TO STARE BLANKLY AT HER BROTHER IN LAW WE SAIL TUESDAY CONTINUED UNCLE JOHN AND YOU MUST HAVE MY NIECE READY IN TIME AND DELIVER HER ON BOARD THE PRINCESS IRENE AT HOBOKEN AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP
4481-17499-0035 IT WILL TAKE A MONTH AT LEAST TO MAKE HER GOWNS AND STUFF AND RUBBISH HE GROWLED THAT SHOWS MARTHA HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIPS NO ONE MAKES GOWNS TO GO ABROAD WITH YOU BUY EM IN PARIS TO BRING HOME
4481-17499-0036 AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
4481-17499-0037 BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY YOU'LL GET ME RILED PRETTY SOON MARTHA AND IF YOU DO YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T THIS SPEECH FRIGHTENED THE WOMAN IT WOULDN'T DO TO PROVOKE UNCLE JOHN HOWEVER UNREASONABLE HE HAPPENED TO BE SO SHE SAID MEEKLY
4481-17499-0038 I'VE NO DOUBT LOUISE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GO AND SO WILL I YOU WHY WHY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TAKING JUST THE THREE GIRLS AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES ALSO MINE BUT YOU'LL WANT A CHAPERONE FOR THEM
4481-17499-0039 WHY SO PROPRIETY REQUIRES IT AND SO DOES ORDINARY PRUDENCE LOUISE I KNOW WILL BE DISCREET FOR IT IS HER NATURE BUT PATSY IS SUCH A LITTLE FLYAWAY
4481-17499-0040 UNCLE JOHN GREW RED AND HIS EYES FLASHED A CHAPERONE HE CRIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY NOT ANY IN MINE MARTHA MERRICK EITHER WE YOUNG FOLKS GO ALONE WITHOUT ANY DEATH'S HEAD TO PERPETUALLY GLOWER AT US
4481-17499-0041 THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
4481-17499-0042 A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
4481-17499-0043 WELL I'M SURE AND THE THING'S SETTLED HE SAID MORE CALMLY DON'T WORRY MA'AM I'LL LOOK AFTER PATSY AND BETH AND LOUISE WILL LOOK AFTER ALL OF US JUST AS SHE DOES AFTER YOU BECAUSE SHE'S SO DISCREET TALK ABOUT YOUR BEING A CHAPERONE
4481-17499-0044 WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
4481-17499-0045 JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
4481-17499-0046 AFTER ALL SHE SIGHED TAKING UP HER CUP AGAIN IT MAY BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LOUISE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOUNG WELDON WHO IS PAYING HER ATTENTIONS JUST NOW IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS FATHER'S MONEY OR NOT HE'S BEEN A BIT WILD I'VE HEARD
4481-17499-0047 AND IT IS JUST AS WELL TO POSTPONE ANY ENGAGEMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE FACTS I CAN DO THAT NICELY WHILE MY SWEET CHILD IS IN EUROPE WITH UNCLE JOHN AND AWAY FROM ALL DANGER OF ENTANGLEMENTS
