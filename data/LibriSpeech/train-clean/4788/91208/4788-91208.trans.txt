4788-91208-0000 IT LOOKS BIG AND IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE EVEN PEOPLE A LONG WAY UP IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THESE ATTRIBUTES PERHAPS NOT AS THE ESSENTIAL ONES OF LEADERSHIP BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS THOSE BY WHICH A LEADER MAY BE RECOGNIZED
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0002 THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
4788-91208-0003 MISTER MILL'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY ARE SUCH AS TO GIVE HIM THE FOREMOST PLACE IN EITHER WHETHER WE REGARD HIM AS AN EXPOUNDER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY HE IS
4788-91208-0004 THE STRUCTURE RAISED BY ADAM SMITH MALTHUS AND RICARDO BUT RAISED IT AT LEAST ONE STORY HIGHER HIS INESTIMABLE SYSTEM OF LOGIC WAS A REVOLUTION IT HARDLY NEEDS OF COURSE TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED MUCH TO HIS PREDECESSORS
4788-91208-0005 THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
4788-91208-0006 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0007 INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE WHEN MISTER MILL COMMENCED HIS LABORS THE ONLY LOGIC RECOGNIZED WAS THE SYLLOGISTIC
4788-91208-0008 IN DEDUCING FROM GENERAL PROPOSITIONS OTHER PROPOSITIONS LESS GENERAL IT WAS EVEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY THAT NOTHING MORE WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT AN INDUCTIVE LOGIC WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS CONCEPTION OF LOGICAL SCIENCE NECESSITATED
4788-91208-0009 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0011 IT COULD OF COURSE BE FASHIONED ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR CONCLUSION IT WAS CALLED IN TO PROVE THUS AN ARTIFICIAL IGNORANCE AS LOCKE CALLS IT WAS PRODUCED WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SANCTIFYING PREJUDICE BY RECOGNIZING SO CALLED NECESSITIES OF THOUGHT
4788-91208-0012 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0014 BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0016 WE NOT ONLY MAY ACCORDING TO MISTER MILL REASON FROM SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES TO OTHERS BUT WE FREQUENTLY DO SO AS HOWEVER THE INSTANCES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE FRESH INSTANCE
4788-91208-0017 THE WORK OF DEDUCTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE FORMULAS AND THEREFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS NOT INFERENTIAL AT ALL THE REAL INFERENCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION WAS ARRIVED AT
4788-91208-0018 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0020 ARE FOR THE MOST PART DEVOTED TO FORTIFYING THIS POSITION AND DEMOLISHING BELIEFS INCONSISTENT WITH IT AS A SYSTEMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST MISTER MILL HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS EITHER PROFESSOR BAIN OR MISTER HERBERT SPENCER
4788-91208-0021 THE PERFECTION OF HIS METHOD ITS APPLICATION AND THE UPROOTING OF PREJUDICES WHICH STOOD IN ITS WAY THIS WAS THE TASK TO WHICH MISTER MILL APPLIED HIMSELF WITH AN ABILITY AND SUCCESS RARELY MATCHED AND NEVER SURPASSED
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0023 VARYING ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SUCH THINKERS AS DOCTOR WHEWELL AND MISTER HERBERT SPENCER HAD TO BE MET IN INTELLECTUAL COMBAT DOCTOR WHEWELL HELD NOT THAT THE INCONCEIVABILITY
4788-91208-0024 OF THE CONTRADICTORY OF A PROPOSITION IS A PROOF OF ITS TRUTH CO EQUAL WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITS VALUE TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE MAY TELL US WHAT IS BUT IT IS BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING IT OTHERWISE
4788-91208-0025 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0026 AS MISTER MILL SAYS THE NAME OF GOD IS VEILED UNDER TWO EXTREMELY ABSTRACT PHRASES INFINITE AND THE ABSOLUTE SO PROFOUND AND FRIENDLY A THINKER AS THE LATE MISTER GROTE HELD THIS RAISING OF THE VEIL INEXPEDIENT BUT HE PROVED
4788-91208-0027 BY A MISTAKE HE FELL INTO THE NECESSITY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE CONCRETE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FORCE OF MISTER MILL'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INFINITE MUST INCLUDE A FARRAGO OF CONTRADICTIONS
4788-91208-0028 IN WHICH THESE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTES INHERE BUT IT WAS AGAINST A CORRESPONDING BEING THE INFINITE THAT MISTER MILL WAS ARGUING IT IS THIS THAT HE CALLS A
4788-91208-0029 AND REGARDED AS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDISSIMUM OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES MAY VERY WELL BE GATHERED FROM A PASSAGE IN HIS REVIEW OF AUGUSTE COMTE A PHILOSOPHER WITH WHOM HE AGREED ON ALL POINTS
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-91208-0033 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
