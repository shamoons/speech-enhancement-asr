4788-94904-0000 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0001 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0003 THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO FULFILL THE DUTIES AND DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES ON THEM THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT ONLY BECOMES A PRACTICAL QUESTION WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED RULER OR A FOREIGN NATION OR NATIONS
4788-94904-0004 WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
4788-94904-0005 THEY HAVE THE READY AND PROPER ANSWER THAT TO BRING IT OVER TO THEIR SIDE IS THE VERY END THEY AIM AT WHEN OPINION IS REALLY ADVERSE ITS HOSTILITY IS USUALLY TO THE FACT OF CHANGE RATHER THAN TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN ITSELF
4788-94904-0006 THE CONTRARY CASE IS NOT INDEED UNEXAMPLED THERE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN A RELIGIOUS REPUGNANCE TO ANY LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF A PARTICULAR LINE OF RULERS BUT IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE MEANT ONLY SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE POWERS THAT BE
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0009 IN A STATE PREVIOUSLY PASSIVE WHEN A PEOPLE HAVE NO SUFFICIENT VALUE FOR AND ATTACHMENT TO A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION THEY HAVE NEXT TO NO CHANCE OF RETAINING IT
4788-94904-0010 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0012 AND IS SURE TO BE WELL SUPPORTED IN DOING SO REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR PERMANENCE UPON THE READINESS OF THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEM IN CASE OF THEIR BEING ENDANGERED IF TOO LITTLE VALUED FOR THIS
4788-94904-0013 THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
4788-94904-0014 THESE CONSIDERATIONS RELATE TO THE FIRST TWO CAUSES OF FAILURE IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE THIRD IS WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT EITHER THE WILL OR THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL THE PART WHICH BELONGS TO THEM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION
4788-94904-0015 WHEN NOBODY OR ONLY SOME SMALL FRACTION FEELS THE DEGREE OF INTEREST IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATE NECESSARY TO THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC OPINION THE ELECTORS WILL SELDOM MAKE ANY USE OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE BUT TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THEIR LOCALITY
4788-94904-0016 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0017 THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
4788-94904-0018 AND THE ONLY FRUIT PRODUCED BY NATIONAL REPRESENTATION IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO REALLY GOVERN THERE IS AN ASSEMBLY QUARTERED ON THE PUBLIC AND NO ABUSE IN WHICH A PORTION OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE INTERESTED IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE REMOVED
4788-94904-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0021 WHICH EXISTS IN THAT COUNTRY THIS BENEFIT HOWEVER IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE COEXISTENCE WITH THE POPULAR BODY OF AN HEREDITARY KING IF INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING FOR THE FAVORS OF THE CHIEF RULER THESE SELFISH AND SORDID FACTIONS STRUGGLED FOR THE CHIEF PLACE ITSELF
4788-94904-0022 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0023 AND THE NAME AND FORMS OF REPRESENTATION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO PREVENT DESPOTISM FROM ATTAINING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY BY WHICH ALONE ITS EVILS CAN BE MITIGATED OR ITS FEW ADVANTAGES REALIZED
4788-94904-0024 THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH IT POSSIBLY MIGHT EXIST BUT IN WHICH SOME OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THESE ARE PRINCIPALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION HAVE SOME LESSON TO LEARN SOME HABIT NOT YET ACQUIRED
4788-94904-0025 TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE CASES IS THE ONE ALREADY CONSIDERED IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO LEARN THE FIRST LESSON OF CIVILIZATION THAT OF OBEDIENCE
4788-94904-0026 A RACE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN ENERGY AND COURAGE BY STRUGGLES WITH NATURE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT WHO HAVE NOT YET SETTLED DOWN INTO PERMANENT OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMON SUPERIOR WOULD BE LITTLE LIKELY TO ACQUIRE THIS HABIT UNDER THE COLLECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN BODY
4788-94904-0027 A REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY DRAWN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT THEIR OWN TURBULENT INSUBORDINATION IT WOULD REFUSE ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE ON THEIR SAVAGE INDEPENDENCE ANY IMPROVING RESTRAINT
4788-94904-0028 A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
4788-94904-0029 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0030 OR UNLESS THE MILITARY CHIEFS ALLY THEMSELVES WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND TURN IT INTO A PROP FOR THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT A PEOPLE ARE NO LESS UNFITTED FOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BY THE CONTRARY FAULT TO THAT LAST SPECIFIED BY EXTREME PASSIVENESS
4788-94904-0031 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0033 EVEN WHEN THE KING WAS SCARCELY SO POWERFUL AS MANY OF HIS CHIEF FEUDATORIES THE GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE DERIVED FROM BEING BUT ONE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY FRENCH HISTORIANS TO HIM THE EYES OF ALL THE LOCALLY OPPRESSED WERE TURNED
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0036 IT ABATED IN THE OPPRESSED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE HABIT OF SUBMITTING TO OPPRESSION THE KING'S INTEREST LAY IN ENCOURAGING ALL PARTIAL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE SERFS TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MASTERS AND PLACE THEMSELVES IN IMMEDIATE SUBORDINATION TO HIMSELF
4788-94904-0037 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
4788-94904-0039 THOUGH GENERALLY MUCH RESTRICTED IN PRACTICE WAS MAINLY INSTRUMENTAL IN CARRYING THE PEOPLE THROUGH A NECESSARY STAGE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF REAL WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM ENTERING UPON
