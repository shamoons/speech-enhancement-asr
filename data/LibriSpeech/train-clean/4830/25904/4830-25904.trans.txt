4830-25904-0000 BEING ALONE IN LONDON YET WISHING TO CELEBRATE THE DAY I DECIDED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LIONS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS A LOVELY PLACE IT WAS AND I ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY FOR MAY DAY IN ENGLAND IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4830-25904-0001 MILD SUNNY FLOWERY AND SPRING LIKE AS I WALKED ALONG THE WELL KEPT PATHS BETWEEN WHITE AND ROSY HAWTHORN HEDGES I KEPT COMING UPON NEW AND CURIOUS SIGHTS
4830-25904-0002 FOR THE BIRDS AND BEASTS ARE SO SKILFULLY ARRANGED THAT IT IS MORE LIKE TRAVELLING THROUGH A STRANGE AND PLEASANT COUNTRY THAN VISITING A MENAGERIE THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A GREAT AMERICAN BISON
4830-25904-0003 AND I WAS SO GLAD TO MEET WITH ANY ONE FROM HOME THAT I'D HAVE PATTED HIM WITH PLEASURE IF HE HAD SHOWN ANY CORDIALITY TOWARD ME HE DIDN'T HOWEVER
4830-25904-0004 AND PUT DOWN HIS IMMENSE HEAD WITH A SULLEN SNORT AS IF HE'D HAVE TOSSED ME WITH GREAT SATISFACTION I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR THE POOR FELLOW WAS HOMESICK DOUBTLESS FOR HIS OWN WIDE PRAIRIES AND THE FREE LIFE HE HAD LOST
4830-25904-0005 SO I THREW HIM SOME FRESH CLOVER AND WENT ON TO THE PELICANS I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT HANDSOME BIRDS THEY WERE NOT GRACEFUL BUT WITH SUCH SNOWY PLUMAGE TINGED WITH PALE PINK AND FAINT YELLOW
4830-25904-0006 THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
4830-25904-0007 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0008 AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
4830-25904-0009 ONE LIONESS WAS ILL AND LAY ON HER BED LOOKING VERY PENSIVE WHILE HER MATE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND MUCH AFFLICTED BY HER SUFFERING
4830-25904-0010 I LIKED THIS LION VERY MUCH FOR THOUGH THE BIGGEST HE WAS VERY GENTLE AND HAD A NOBLE FACE THE TIGERS WERE RUSHING ABOUT AS TIGERS USUALLY ARE SOME CREEPING NOISELESSLY TO AND FRO
4830-25904-0011 SOME LEAPING UP AND DOWN AND SOME WASHING THEIR FACES WITH THEIR VELVET PAWS ALL LOOKED AND ACTED SO LIKE CATS THAT I WASN'T AT ALL SURPRISED TO HEAR ONE OF THEM PURR WHEN THE KEEPER SCRATCHED HER HEAD
4830-25904-0012 IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND LARGE PURR BUT NO FIRESIDE PUSSY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER AND EVERY ONE LAUGHED AT THE SOUND THERE WERE PRETTY SPOTTED LEOPARDS PANTHERS AND SMALLER VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES
4830-25904-0013 I SAT WATCHING THEM A LONG TIME LONGING TO LET SOME OF THE WILD THINGS OUT FOR A GOOD RUN THEY SEEMED SO UNHAPPY BARRED IN THOSE SMALL DENS SUDDENLY THE LIONS BEGAN TO ROAR THE TIGERS TO SNARL
4830-25904-0014 AND ALL TO GET VERY MUCH EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING SNIFFING AT THE OPENINGS THRUSTING THEIR PAWS THROUGH THE BARS AND LASHING THEIR TAILS IMPATIENTLY I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS TILL
4830-25904-0015 THIS WAS THEIR DINNER AND AS THEY WERE FED BUT ONCE A DAY THEY WERE RAVENOUS SUCH ROARS AND HOWLS AND CRIES AS AROSE WHILE THE MAN WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE LINE
4830-25904-0016 GAVE ONE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SOUNDS TO BE HEARD IN INDIAN FORESTS AND JUNGLES THE LIONS BEHAVED BEST FOR THEY ONLY PACED UP AND DOWN WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRY BUT THE TIGERS WERE QUITE FRANTIC
4830-25904-0017 FOR THEY TUMBLED ONE OVER THE OTHER SHOOK THE CAGES AND TRIED TO REACH THE BYSTANDERS
4830-25904-0018 ONE LADY HAD A FRIGHT FOR THE WIND BLEW THE END OF HER SHAWL WITHIN REACH OF A TIGER'S GREAT CLAW AND HE CLUTCHED IT TRYING TO DRAG HER NEARER THE SHAWL CAME OFF AND THE POOR LADY RAN AWAY SCREAMING
4830-25904-0019 AS IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF WILD BEASTS WERE AFTER HER
4830-25904-0020 THE TIGERS SNARLED AND FOUGHT AND TORE AND GOT SO SAVAGE I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY WERE SAFELY SHUT UP IN A FEW MINUTES NOTHING BUT WHITE BONES REMAINED AND THEN THEY HOWLED FOR MORE
4830-25904-0021 ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
4830-25904-0022 ALL BUT MY FAVOURITE WHO CARRIED HIS SHARE TO HIS SICK MATE AND BY EVERY GENTLE MEANS IN HIS POWER TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT SHE WAS TOO ILL HOWEVER AND TURNED AWAY WITH A PLAINTIVE MOAN WHICH SEEMED TO GRIEVE HIM SADLY
4830-25904-0023 HE WOULDN'T TOUCH HIS DINNER BUT LAY DOWN NEAR HER WITH THE LUMP BETWEEN HIS PAWS AS IF GUARDING IT FOR HER AND THERE I LEFT HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN SPITE OF HIS HUNGER TILL HIS MATE COULD SHARE IT WITH HIM
4830-25904-0024 AS I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT HIS FINE OLD FACE I NAMED HIM DOUGLAS AND WALKED AWAY HUMMING TO MYSELF THE LINES OF THE BALLAD DOUGLAS DOUGLAS TENDER AND TRUE
4830-25904-0025 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4830-25904-0026 WHO PLAYED LIKE BOYS AND CUT UP ALL SORTS OF CAPERS A MAMMA SAT TENDING HER BABY AND LOOKING SO LIKE A LITTLE OLD WOMAN THAT I LAUGHED TILL THE GRAY MONKEY WITH THE BLUE NOSE SCOLDED AT ME
4830-25904-0027 HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
4830-25904-0028 NUT SHELLS AND STRAWS DOWN ON HIM FROM ABOVE AS THEY CLIMBED ABOUT THE PERCHES OR SWUNG BY THEIR TAILS ONE POOR LITTLE CHAP HAD LOST THE CURLY END OF HIS TAIL I'M AFRAID THE GRAY ONE BIT IT OFF
4830-25904-0029 AND KEPT TRYING TO SWING LIKE THE OTHERS FORGETTING THAT THE STRONG CURLY END WAS WHAT HE HELD ON WITH HE WOULD RUN UP THE BARE BOUGHS AND GIVE A JUMP EXPECTING TO CATCH AND SWING BUT THE LAME TAIL WOULDN'T HOLD HIM AND DOWN HE'D GO
4830-25904-0030 BOUNCE ON TO THE STRAW AT FIRST HE'D SIT AND STARE ABOUT HIM AS IF MUCH AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF THERE THEN HE'D SCRATCH HIS LITTLE ROUND HEAD AND BEGIN TO SCOLD VIOLENTLY WHICH SEEMED TO DELIGHT THE OTHER MONKEYS
4830-25904-0031 AND FINALLY HE'D EXAMINE HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL AND APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM THE FUNNY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND I ENJOYED SEEING HIM VERY MUCH
4830-25904-0032 AND GAVE HIM A BUN TO COMFORT HIM WHEN I WENT AWAY THE SNAKE HOUSE CAME NEXT AND I WENT IN ON MY WAY TO VISIT THE RHINOCEROS FAMILY I RATHER LIKE SNAKES
4830-25904-0033 SINCE I HAD A TAME GREEN ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE DOOR STEP AND WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME ON SUNNY DAYS THESE SNAKES I FOUND VERY INTERESTING ONLY THEY GOT UNDER THEIR BLANKETS AND WOULDN'T COME OUT AND I WASN'T ALLOWED TO POKE THEM
4830-25904-0034 AND BLINKED AT ME THROUGH THE GLASS LOOKING QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS HE WAS THERE WERE BIG AND LITTLE SNAKES BLACK BROWN AND SPECKLED LIVELY AND LAZY PRETTY AND PLAIN ONES BUT I LIKED THE GREAT BOA
4830-25904-0035 BEST WHEN I CAME TO HIS CAGE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT THE BRANCH OF A TREE SUCH AS I HAD SEEN IN OTHER CAGES FOR THE SNAKES TO WIND UP AND DOWN WHERE IS HE I WONDER I HOPE HE HASN'T GOT
4830-25904-0036 OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
4830-25904-0037 AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
4830-25904-0038 AND LAY SO STILL I HAD NOT SEEN HIM TILL HE CAME TO TAKE A LOOK AT ME A VERY VILLAINOUS LOOKING REPTILE HE WAS AND I FELT GRATEFUL THAT I DIDN'T LIVE IN A COUNTRY
4830-25904-0039 WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
4830-25904-0040 AND THEN KNOTTED HIS ROUGH GRAYISH BODY INTO A GREAT LOOP WITH THE FIERY EYED HEAD IN THE MIDDLE HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE LARGEST KIND BUT I WAS QUITE SATISFIED AND LEFT HIM TO HIS DINNER OF RABBITS
4830-25904-0041 WHICH I HADN'T THE HEART TO STAY AND SEE HIM DEVOUR ALIVE I WAS WALKING TOWARD THE CAMEL'S PAGODA WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LONG DARK CURLING THING CAME OVER MY SHOULDER AND I FELT WARM BREATH IN MY FACE IT'S THE BOA I THOUGHT
4830-25904-0042 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0043 I WALKED BESIDE HIM EXAMINING HIS CLUMSY FEET AND PEERING UP AT HIS SMALL INTELLIGENT EYE I'M VERY SURE HE WINKED AT ME AS IF ENJOYING THE JOKE AND KEPT POKING HIS TRUNK INTO MY POCKET
4830-25904-0044 HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING EATABLE I FELT AS IF I HAD GOT INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AS I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND SAW ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS WALKING AMONG THE TREES FLOCKS OF SNOW WHITE CRANES STALKING OVER THE GRASS
4830-25904-0045 ON THEIR LONG SCARLET LEGS STRIPED ZEBRAS RACING IN THEIR PADDOCK QUEER KANGAROOS HOPPING ABOUT WITH LITTLE ONES IN THEIR POUCHES PRETTY ANTELOPES CHASING ONE ANOTHER
4830-25904-0046 AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
4830-25904-0047 AND CAME AT THE KEEPER'S CALL TO KISS HIM AND FLOUNDER ON ITS FLIPPERS ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TANK AFTER A FISH IT WAS VERY LIKE A SEAL ONLY MUCH LARGER AND HAD FOUR FINS INSTEAD OF TWO
4830-25904-0048 ITS EYES WERE LOVELY SO DARK AND SOFT AND LIQUID BUT ITS MOUTH WAS NOT PRETTY AND I DECLINED ONE OF THE DAMP KISSES WHICH IT WAS READY TO DISPENSE AT WORD OF COMMAND
4830-25904-0049 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4830-25904-0050 HE LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY AND I THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT THEY DIDN'T INVENT A BIG REFRIGERATOR FOR HIM THESE ARE NOT HALF OF THE WONDERFUL CREATURES I SAW
