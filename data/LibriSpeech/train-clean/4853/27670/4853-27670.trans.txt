4853-27670-0000 I LAY FOR A LONG WHILE INSENSIBLE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY MIND INSTEAD OF DYING IN THAT SWOON I MUST EVER ACCOUNT AS THE GREATEST WONDER OF A LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE MARVELLOUS
4853-27670-0001 I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
4853-27670-0002 MY CLOTHES WEIGHED UPON ME LIKE A SUIT OF ARMOUR SO INFLEXIBLY HARD WERE THEY FROZEN YET I GOT UPON MY LEGS AND FOUND THAT I COULD STAND AND WALK AND THAT LIFE FLOWED WARM IN MY VEINS
4853-27670-0003 IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
4853-27670-0004 THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
4853-27670-0005 THE BRIG PITCHED AND ROLLED HEAVILY MUCH OF THE BUOYANCY OF HER EARLIER DANCE WAS GONE OUT OF HER NEVERTHELESS I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THIS SLUGGISHNESS WAS ALTOGETHER DUE TO THE WATER SHE HAD TAKEN IN
4853-27670-0006 IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
4853-27670-0007 FINDING THAT I HAD THE USE OF MY VOICE I HOLLOAED AS LOUDLY AS I COULD BUT NO HUMAN NOTE RESPONDED THREE OR FOUR TIMES I SHOUTED GIVING SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEIR NAMES BUT IN VAIN FATHER OF MERCY I THOUGHT
4853-27670-0008 WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD CERTAINLY FIVE MEN AT LEAST WERE LIVING BEFORE WE FOULED THE ICE AND AGAIN I CRIED OUT IS THERE ANY ONE ALIVE
4853-27670-0009 MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
4853-27670-0010 IT WAS DREADFUL I SAY TO BE THUS PLACED AND TO FEEL THAT I WAS IN THE HEART OF THE RUDEST MOST DESOLATE SPACE OF SEA IN THE WORLD INTO WHICH THE COMMERCE OF THE EARTH DISPATCHED BUT FEW SHIPS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
4853-27670-0011 BUT NO FEATURE OF MY LAMENTABLE SITUATION SO AFFRIGHTED ME SO WORKED UPON THE PASSIONS OF MY MIND AS MY LONELINESS OH FOR ONE COMPANION
4853-27670-0012 EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
4853-27670-0013 MISERY AND HORROR WERE WITHIN THAT SHADOW AND BEYOND IT NOTHING THAT MY SPIRIT COULD LOOK UP TO I STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS AS ONE STUNNED AND THEN MY MANHOOD TRAINED TO SOME PURPOSE BY THE USAGE OF THE SEA
4853-27670-0014 REASSERTED ITSELF AND MAYBE I ALSO GOT SOME SLENDER COMFORT FROM OBSERVING THAT DULL AND HEAVY AS WAS THE MOTION OF THE BRIG THERE WAS YET THE BUOYANCY OF VITALITY IN HER MANNER OF MOUNTING THE SEAS AND THAT AFTER ALL
4853-27670-0015 HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
4853-27670-0016 BY PREVENTING THE SEAS WHICH WASHED ON TO THE FORECASTLE FROM CASCADING WITH THEIR FORMER VIOLENCE AFT ALSO THAT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MAIN AND TOP MASTS LAY UPON THE LARBOARD RAIL AND OVER THE SIDE
4853-27670-0017 MY EYES DIRECTLY SOUGHT IT AND FOUND THE TIME TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TEN THIS SIGNIFIED THAT I HAD TEN OR ELEVEN HOURS OF DARKNESS BEFORE ME
4853-27670-0018 I TOOK DOWN THE LAMP TRIMMED IT AND WENT TO THE LAZARETTE HATCH AT THE AFTER END OF THE CABIN HERE WERE KEPT THE STORES FOR THE CREW
4853-27670-0019 I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
4853-27670-0020 AND I THEN WITH A SEAMAN'S DISPATCH SHIFTED THE REST OF MY APPAREL AND CANNOT EXPRESS HOW GREATLY I WAS COMFORTED BY THE CHANGE THOUGH THE JACKET AND TROUSERS I PUT ON WERE STILL DAMP WITH THE SOAKING OF PREVIOUS DAYS
4853-27670-0021 I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
4853-27670-0022 NEVERTHELESS ITS RAYS SUFFERED ME TO GUESS AT THE PICTURE OF RUIN THE DECKS OFFERED THE MAIN MAST WAS SNAPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE DECK AND THE STUMP OF IT SHOWED AS JAGGED AND BARBED AS A WILD BEAST'S TEETH
4853-27670-0023 BUT I NOW NOTICED THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HAMPER BEING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE BALANCED THE LIST THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HER SHIFTED BALLAST AND THAT SHE FLOATED ON A LEVEL KEEL WITH HER BOWS FAIR AT THE SEA
4853-27670-0024 I MOVED WITH EXTREME CAUTION CASTING THE LANTERN LIGHT BEFORE ME SOMETIMES STARTING AT A SOUND THAT RESEMBLED A GROAN THEN STOPPING TO STEADY MYSELF DURING SOME PARTICULAR WILD LEAP OF THE HULL
4853-27670-0025 UNTIL COMING ABREAST OF THE MAIN HATCH THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN STRUCK UPON A MAN'S BODY WHICH ON MY BRINGING THE FLAME TO HIS FACE PROVED TO BE CAPTAIN ROSY THERE WAS A WOUND OVER HIS RIGHT BROW
4853-27670-0026 AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
4853-27670-0027 THAT NO EXECUTIONER COULD HAVE GONE MORE ARTISTICALLY TO WORK TO PINION AND CHOKE A MAN UNDER A MASS OF RIGGING IN THE LARBOARD SCUPPERS LAY TWO BODIES AS I COULD JUST FAINTLY DISCERN
4853-27670-0028 FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
4853-27670-0029 I CROSSED TO THE STARBOARD SIDE WHERE THE DECK WAS COMPARATIVELY CLEAR AND FOUND THE BODY OF A SEAMAN NAMED ABRAHAM WISE NEAR THE FORE HATCH
4853-27670-0030 NO LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE COMMAND OF COULD PUT BEFORE YOU THE HORROR THAT POSSESSED ME AS I SAT MEDITATING UPON MY SITUATION AND RECALLING THE FACES OF THE DEAD THE WIND WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WITH IT THE SEA
4853-27670-0031 BUT THE MOTION OF THE BRIG CONTINUED VERY HEAVY A LARGE SWELL HAVING BEEN SET RUNNING BY THE LONG FIERCE GALE THAT WAS GONE AND THERE BEING NO UPROAR OF TEMPEST IN THE SKY TO CONFOUND THE SENSES
4853-27670-0032 I COULD HEAR A HUNDRED HARSH AND MELANCHOLY GROANING AND STRAINING SOUNDS RISING FROM THE HULL WITH NOW AND AGAIN A MIGHTY BLOW AS FROM SOME SPAR OR LUMP OF ICE ALONGSIDE WEIGHTY ENOUGH YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED TO STAVE THE SHIP
4853-27670-0033 NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
4853-27670-0034 TO JUDGE BY THE SOUND OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE VESSEL THAT SHE WAS FILLING I KNEW WELL YET NOT LEAKING SO RAPIDLY BUT THAT HAD OUR CREW BEEN PRESERVED WE MIGHT EASILY HAVE KEPT HER FREE
4853-27670-0035 I HAD NOTICED THE JOLLY BOAT BOTTOM UP NEAR THE STARBOARD GANGWAY AND SO FAR AS I COULD MAKE OUT BY THROWING THE DULL LANTERN LIGHT UPON HER SHE WAS SOUND BUT I COULD NOT HAVE LAUNCHED HER WITHOUT SEEING WHAT I WAS DOING
4853-27670-0036 AND EVEN HAD I MANAGED THIS SHE STOOD TO BE SWAMPED AND I TO BE DROWNED
