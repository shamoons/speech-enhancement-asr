4853-27671-0000 THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
4853-27671-0001 I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
4853-27671-0002 AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
4853-27671-0003 YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
4853-27671-0004 ONE EXTRAORDINARY STROKE I QUICKLY DETECTED THE JOLLY BOAT HAD LAIN STOWED IN THE LONG BOAT IT WAS THUS WE CARRIED THOSE BOATS THE LITTLE ONE LYING SNUGLY ENOUGH IN THE OTHER THE SEA THAT HAD FLOODED OUR DECKS
4853-27671-0005 HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
4853-27671-0006 AND THERE LAY THE LONG BOAT CRUSHED INTO STAVES THIS SIGNAL AND SURPRISING INTERVENTION FILLED MY HEART WITH THANKFULNESS THOUGH MY SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF MY POOR DROWNED SHIPMATES
4853-27671-0007 AND SO MADE A TACKLE BY THE HELP OF WHICH I TURNED THE JOLLY BOAT OVER I THEN WITH A HANDSPIKE PRISED HER NOSE TO THE GANGWAY SECURED A BUNCH OF ROPE ON EITHER SIDE HER TO ACT AS FENDERS OR BUFFERS
4853-27671-0008 WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
4853-27671-0009 BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
4853-27671-0010 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0011 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0012 THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
4853-27671-0013 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
4853-27671-0014 WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
4853-27671-0015 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0016 TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0018 WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
4853-27671-0019 I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
4853-27671-0020 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0022 AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
4853-27671-0023 IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-27671-0025 AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
4853-27671-0026 AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
4853-27671-0027 THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
4853-27671-0028 ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
4853-27671-0029 WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-27671-0031 THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
4853-27671-0032 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0034 BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
4853-27671-0035 LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
4853-27671-0036 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0037 WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
4853-27671-0038 THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
4853-27671-0039 IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
4853-27671-0040 IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
