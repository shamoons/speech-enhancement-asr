4853-29413-0000 GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
4853-29413-0001 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0002 THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0004 WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
4853-29413-0005 I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
4853-29413-0006 WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
4853-29413-0007 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0008 IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
4853-29413-0009 WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
4853-29413-0010 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0011 THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
4853-29413-0012 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0013 THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
4853-29413-0014 TO GIVE HIM SOME IDEA OF THE JEALOUS HATRED WITH WHICH THE CUR REGARDED ME HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO WARN ME WITHOUT ACTUALLY BETRAYING THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM STARVATION OR THE WORKHOUSE AND HE HAD FAILED
4853-29413-0015 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0017 A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
4853-29413-0018 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0019 IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
4853-29413-0020 THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
4853-29413-0021 THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
4853-29413-0022 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0023 WHATEVER SHE SAW HIM DRINK SHE WAS TO INSIST ON YOUR DRINKING IT TOO YOU HEARD ME ASK LEAVE TO MAKE THE TEA YES WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALS AGREED ON BETWEEN US
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0025 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
4853-29413-0026 I SHOULD SAY NO JUDGING BY HIS LOOKS HE TURNED PALE WHEN HE FELT THE FLOOR SHAKEN BY YOUR FALL FOR ONCE IN A WAY HE WAS HONEST HONESTLY FRIGHTENED I NOTICED THE SAME THING SIR WHEN HE PICKED ME UP OFF THE FLOOR
4853-29413-0027 A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
4853-29413-0028 IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4853-29413-0029 WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
4853-29413-0030 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4853-29413-0032 AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
