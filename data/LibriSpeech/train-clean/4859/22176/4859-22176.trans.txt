4859-22176-0000 AT THE END OF JANUARY PIERRE WENT TO MOSCOW AND STAYED IN AN ANNEX OF HIS HOUSE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED HE CALLED ON COUNT ROSTOPCHIN AND ON SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO WERE BACK IN MOSCOW AND HE INTENDED TO LEAVE FOR PETERSBURG TWO DAYS LATER
4859-22176-0001 EVERYBODY WAS CELEBRATING THE VICTORY EVERYTHING WAS BUBBLING WITH LIFE IN THE RUINED BUT REVIVING CITY EVERYONE WAS PLEASED TO SEE PIERRE EVERYONE WISHED TO MEET HIM AND EVERYONE QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN PIERRE FELT PARTICULARLY WELL DISPOSED TOWARD THEM ALL
4859-22176-0002 BUT WAS NOW INSTINCTIVELY ON HIS GUARD FOR FEAR OF BINDING HIMSELF IN ANY WAY TO ALL QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM WHETHER IMPORTANT OR QUITE TRIFLING SUCH AS WHERE WOULD HE LIVE WAS HE GOING TO REBUILD WHEN WAS HE GOING TO PETERSBURG
4859-22176-0003 AND WOULD HE MIND TAKING A PARCEL FOR SOMEONE HE REPLIED YES PERHAPS OR I THINK SO AND SO ON HE HAD HEARD THAT THE ROSTOVS WERE AT KOSTROMA BUT THE THOUGHT OF NATASHA SELDOM OCCURRED TO HIM
4859-22176-0004 IF IT DID IT WAS ONLY AS A PLEASANT MEMORY OF THE DISTANT PAST HE FELT HIMSELF NOT ONLY FREE FROM SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS BUT ALSO FROM THAT FEELING WHICH IT SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD AROUSED IN HIMSELF ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE HEARD FROM THE DRUBETSKOYS
4859-22176-0005 THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW THE DEATH SUFFERINGS AND LAST DAYS OF PRINCE ANDREW HAD OFTEN OCCUPIED PIERRE'S THOUGHTS AND NOW RECURRED TO HIM WITH FRESH VIVIDNESS HAVING HEARD AT DINNER THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW AND LIVING IN HER HOUSE
4859-22176-0006 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED IN VOZDVIZHENKA STREET HE DROVE THAT SAME EVENING TO SEE HER ON HIS WAY TO THE HOUSE PIERRE KEPT THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP OF HIS VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH HIM AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LAST ONE AT BORODINO
4859-22176-0007 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE DIED IN THE BITTER FRAME OF MIND HE WAS THEN IN IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE MEANING OF LIFE WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO HIM BEFORE HE DIED THOUGHT PIERRE HE RECALLED KARATAEV AND HIS DEATH AND INVOLUNTARILY BEGAN TO COMPARE THESE TWO MEN SO DIFFERENT
4859-22176-0008 AND YET SO SIMILAR IN THAT THEY HAD BOTH LIVED AND BOTH DIED AND IN THE LOVE HE FELT FOR BOTH OF THEM PIERRE DROVE UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE OLD PRINCE IN A MOST SERIOUS MOOD THE HOUSE HAD ESCAPED THE FIRE IT SHOWED SIGNS OF DAMAGE BUT ITS GENERAL ASPECT WAS UNCHANGED THE OLD FOOTMAN
4859-22176-0009 WHO MET PIERRE WITH A STERN FACE AS IF WISHING TO MAKE THE VISITOR FEEL THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE OLD PRINCE HAD NOT DISTURBED THE ORDER OF THINGS IN THE HOUSE INFORMED HIM THAT THE PRINCESS HAD GONE TO HER OWN APARTMENTS AND THAT SHE RECEIVED ON SUNDAYS ANNOUNCE ME PERHAPS SHE WILL SEE ME SAID PIERRE
4859-22176-0010 YES SIR SAID THE MAN PLEASE STEP INTO THE PORTRAIT GALLERY A FEW MINUTES LATER THE FOOTMAN RETURNED
4859-22176-0011 IN A RATHER LOW ROOM LIT BY ONE CANDLE SAT THE PRINCESS AND WITH HER ANOTHER PERSON DRESSED IN BLACK PIERRE REMEMBERED THAT THE PRINCESS ALWAYS HAD LADY COMPANIONS BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE LIKE HE NEVER KNEW OR REMEMBERED THIS MUST BE ONE OF HER COMPANIONS HE THOUGHT
4859-22176-0012 GLANCING AT THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS THE PRINCESS ROSE QUICKLY TO MEET HIM AND HELD OUT HER HAND YES SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIS ALTERED FACE AFTER HE HAD KISSED HER HAND SO THIS IS HOW WE MEET AGAIN
4859-22176-0013 HE SPOKE OF YOU EVEN AT THE VERY LAST SHE WENT ON TURNING HER EYES FROM PIERRE TO HER COMPANION WITH A SHYNESS THAT SURPRISED HIM FOR AN INSTANT I WAS SO GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUR SAFETY IT WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF GOOD NEWS WE HAD RECEIVED FOR A LONG TIME
4859-22176-0014 ALL I KNOW I HEARD AT SECOND HAND FROM OTHERS I ONLY KNOW THAT HE FELL IN WITH THE ROSTOVS WHAT A STRANGE COINCIDENCE PIERRE SPOKE RAPIDLY AND WITH ANIMATION HE GLANCED ONCE AT THE COMPANION'S FACE SAW HER ATTENTIVE AND KINDLY GAZE FIXED ON HIM
4859-22176-0015 AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN ONE IS TALKING FELT SOMEHOW THAT THIS COMPANION IN THE BLACK DRESS WAS A GOOD KIND EXCELLENT CREATURE WHO WOULD NOT HINDER HIS CONVERSING FREELY WITH PRINCESS MARY BUT WHEN HE MENTIONED THE ROSTOVS PRINCESS MARY'S FACE EXPRESSED STILL GREATER EMBARRASSMENT
4859-22176-0016 SHE AGAIN GLANCED RAPIDLY FROM PIERRE'S FACE TO THAT OF THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS AND SAID DO YOU REALLY NOT RECOGNIZE HER PIERRE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE COMPANION'S PALE DELICATE FACE WITH ITS BLACK EYES AND PECULIAR MOUTH AND SOMETHING NEAR TO HIM LONG FORGOTTEN AND MORE THAN SWEET
4859-22176-0017 LOOKED AT HIM FROM THOSE ATTENTIVE EYES BUT NO IT CAN'T BE HE THOUGHT THIS STERN THIN PALE FACE THAT LOOKS SO MUCH OLDER IT CANNOT BE SHE IT MERELY REMINDS ME OF HER BUT AT THAT MOMENT PRINCESS MARY SAID NATASHA
4859-22176-0018 AND WITH DIFFICULTY EFFORT AND STRESS LIKE THE OPENING OF A DOOR GROWN RUSTY ON ITS HINGES A SMILE APPEARED ON THE FACE WITH THE ATTENTIVE EYES AND FROM THAT OPENING DOOR CAME A BREATH OF FRAGRANCE WHICH SUFFUSED PIERRE WITH A HAPPINESS HE HAD LONG FORGOTTEN
4859-22176-0019 AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
4859-22176-0020 AT THAT MOMENT PIERRE INVOLUNTARILY BETRAYED TO HER TO PRINCESS MARY AND ABOVE ALL TO HIMSELF A SECRET OF WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN UNAWARE HE FLUSHED JOYFULLY YET WITH PAINFUL DISTRESS HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS AGITATION BUT THE MORE HE TRIED TO HIDE IT THE MORE CLEARLY
4859-22176-0021 CLEARER THAN ANY WORDS COULD HAVE DONE DID HE BETRAY TO HIMSELF TO HER AND TO PRINCESS MARY THAT HE LOVED HER NO IT'S ONLY THE UNEXPECTEDNESS OF IT THOUGHT PIERRE BUT AS SOON AS HE TRIED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE HAD BEGUN WITH PRINCESS MARY HE AGAIN GLANCED AT NATASHA
4859-22176-0022 HE BECAME CONFUSED IN HIS SPEECH AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING
4859-22176-0023 BUT HE HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HER BECAUSE THE CHANGE IN HER SINCE HE LAST SAW HER WAS IMMENSE SHE HAD GROWN THIN AND PALE BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT MADE HER UNRECOGNIZABLE SHE WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE AT THE MOMENT HE ENTERED
4859-22176-0024 BECAUSE ON THAT FACE WHOSE EYES HAD ALWAYS SHONE WITH A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND GLANCED AT HER THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A SMILE ONLY HER EYES WERE KINDLY ATTENTIVE AND SADLY INTERROGATIVE
