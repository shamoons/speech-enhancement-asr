4859-29340-0000 WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTAND THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS IN THEIR NARRATION EVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER
4859-29340-0001 OR IN GENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KIND OF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARE SATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENT
4859-29340-0002 AS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL MEANING FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLY BUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS
4859-29340-0003 ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
4859-29340-0004 BESIDES THIS HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVEN IN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOME PARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED THIERS A BONAPARTIST SAYS THAT NAPOLEON'S POWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS
4859-29340-0005 LANFREY A REPUBLICAN SAYS IT WAS BASED ON HIS TRICKERY AND DECEPTION OF THE PEOPLE SO THE HISTORIANS OF THIS CLASS BY MUTUALLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER'S POSITIONS DESTROY THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0006 AND FURNISH NO REPLY TO HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY WHO DEAL WITH ALL THE NATIONS SEEM TO RECOGNIZE HOW ERRONEOUS IS THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS VIEW OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0007 THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLY DIRECTED FORCES IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE A GENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT
4859-29340-0008 NOT IN THE POWER OF ONE MAN BUT IN THE INTERACTION OF MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE POWER OF HISTORICAL PERSONAGES REPRESENTED AS THE PRODUCT OF MANY FORCES CAN NO LONGER IT WOULD SEEM
4859-29340-0009 BE REGARDED AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS AND TREAT IT AS THEIR CAUSE
4859-29340-0010 IN THEIR EXPOSITION AN HISTORIC CHARACTER IS FIRST THE PRODUCT OF HIS TIME AND HIS POWER ONLY THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE PRODUCING EVENTS GERVINUS SCHLOSSER AND OTHERS FOR INSTANCE
4859-29340-0011 AT ONE TIME PROVE NAPOLEON TO BE A PRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION OF THE IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND SO FORTH AND AT ANOTHER PLAINLY SAY THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND OTHER THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE WERE SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF NAPOLEON'S MISDIRECTED WILL
4859-29340-0012 AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER BUT NAPOLEON'S POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION
4859-29340-0013 AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE THIS CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IS NOT ACCIDENTAL NOT ONLY DOES IT OCCUR AT EVERY STEP BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ACCOUNTS ARE ALL MADE UP OF A CHAIN OF SUCH CONTRADICTIONS
4859-29340-0014 THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS BECAUSE AFTER ENTERING THE FIELD OF ANALYSIS THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STOP HALFWAY TO FIND COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO THE COMPOSITE OR RESULTANT FORCE THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS MUST EQUAL THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0015 AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT COMPONENTS ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION
4859-29340-0016 SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OR THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF ALEXANDER BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS REFUTING THIS OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN
4859-29340-0017 TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE ALEXANDER'S WILL SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN METTERNICH MADAME DE STAEL TALLEYRAND
4859-29340-0018 FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
4859-29340-0019 TALLEYRAND MADAME DE STAEL AND THE OTHERS EVIDENTLY DOES NOT EQUAL THE RESULTANT NAMELY THE PHENOMENON OF MILLIONS OF FRENCHMEN SUBMITTING TO THE BOURBONS THAT CHATEAUBRIAND MADAME DE STAEL
4859-29340-0020 BUT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS AND THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN HOW FROM THESE RELATIONS OF THEIRS THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RESULTED THAT IS HOW COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO ONE A GAVE A RESULTANT EQUAL TO A THOUSAND TIMES A
4859-29340-0021 THE HISTORIAN IS AGAIN OBLIGED TO FALL BACK ON POWER THE FORCE HE HAD DENIED AND TO RECOGNIZE IT AS THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES THAT IS HE HAS TO ADMIT AN UNEXPLAINED FORCE ACTING ON THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0022 AND THAT IS JUST WHAT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS DO AND CONSEQUENTLY
4859-29340-0023 BUT CONTRADICT THEMSELVES PEASANTS HAVING NO CLEAR IDEA OF THE CAUSE OF RAIN SAY ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY WANT RAIN OR FINE WEATHER THE WIND HAS BLOWN THE CLOUDS AWAY OR THE WIND HAS BROUGHT UP THE CLOUDS
4859-29340-0024 AND IN THE SAME WAY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH THEIR THEORY SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0025 A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
4859-29340-0026 THEY SEE IT IN WHAT IS CALLED CULTURE IN MENTAL ACTIVITY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE ARE QUITE CONSISTENT IN REGARD TO THEIR PROGENITORS THE WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORIES FOR IF HISTORICAL EVENTS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS TREATED ONE ANOTHER IN SUCH AND SUCH WAYS
4859-29340-0027 WHY NOT EXPLAIN THEM BY THE FACT THAT SUCH AND SUCH PEOPLE WROTE SUCH AND SUCH BOOKS OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF INDICATIONS ACCOMPANYING EVERY VITAL PHENOMENON THESE HISTORIANS SELECT THE INDICATION OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND SAY THAT THIS INDICATION IS THE CAUSE
4859-29340-0028 ONLY BY A GREAT STRETCH CAN ONE ADMIT THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES AND IN NO CASE CAN ONE ADMIT THAT INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY CONTROLS PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
4859-29340-0029 FOR THAT VIEW IS NOT CONFIRMED BY SUCH FACTS AS THE VERY CRUEL MURDERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF MAN OR THE VERY CRUEL WARS AND EXECUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PREACHING OF LOVE BUT EVEN ADMITTING AS CORRECT
4859-29340-0030 ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLED ADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY SOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEA HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILL REMAINS UNANSWERED
4859-29340-0031 AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THE INFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ANOTHER NEWER FORCE THE IDEA IS ADDED THE CONNECTION OF WHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION
4859-29340-0032 IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NAPOLEON HAD POWER AND SO EVENTS OCCURRED WITH SOME EFFORT ONE MAY EVEN CONCEIVE THAT NAPOLEON TOGETHER WITH OTHER INFLUENCES WAS THE CAUSE OF AN EVENT BUT HOW A BOOK
4859-29340-0033 HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING FRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENT UNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY
4859-29340-0034 JUST AS SUCH A CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE HANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE
4859-29340-0035 ONE THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN AND SO IT IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASS SUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY JUST AS A SIMILAR BELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE
4859-29340-0036 TO TRADERS AGRICULTURISTS AND SOLDIERS IF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT WRITE HISTORY AND TWO THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ENLIGHTENMENT CIVILIZATION CULTURE IDEAS ARE ALL INDISTINCT
4859-29340-0037 INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONS UNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESS DEFINITE MEANING AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANY THEORY BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KIND
4859-29340-0038 WHICH MAY POSSIBLY EVEN BE OF USE TO SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING THE HISTORIES OF CULTURE
4859-29340-0039 ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLY AND MINUTELY EXAMINING
4859-29340-0040 AS SOON AS THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE AN ACTUAL HISTORIC EVENT SUCH AS THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE FOR INSTANCE THEY INVOLUNTARILY DESCRIBE IT AS RESULTING FROM AN EXERCISE OF POWER AND SAY PLAINLY THAT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF NAPOLEON'S WILL SPEAKING SO
4859-29340-0041 THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND SHOW THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN HISTORY
