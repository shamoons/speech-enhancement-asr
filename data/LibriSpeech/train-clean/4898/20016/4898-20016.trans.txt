4898-20016-0000 HASTENING TO BEGIN HIS WORK THE TOWN IS AN OLD FASHIONED ONE AND ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH FESTIVAL IS NO LONGER FROWNED UPON AS IN YEARS PAST YET IT HAS BEEN LITTLE REGARDED
4898-20016-0001 ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF WHICH NATHAN IS A MEMBER AS THE SADDLER MOUNTED THE STEPS OF HIS SHOP HE FELT THE BLOOD SO RUSH ALONG HIS LIMBS AND TINGLE IN HIS FINGERS
4898-20016-0002 THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR STANDING WITHOUT THE DOOR FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO ENJOY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WARMTH WITHIN HIM OVER THE COLD MORNING AIR THE LITTLE STONE CHURCH
4898-20016-0003 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0004 NATHAN THOUGHT THAT IT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE SOFTENING TWILIGHT OF THE MORNING WHILE NATHAN STOOD MUSING WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE CHURCH
4898-20016-0005 ALTHOUGH A GOOD DEAL STOOPING WITH LONG STRAIGHT AND VERY WHITE HAIR FALLING OVER HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM THE BLACK VELVET CAP AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WORE
4898-20016-0006 AS TO WHO THE STRANGER COULD BE WHEN HE BEHELD HIM TURN IN BETWEEN THE POSTS BY THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH TREAD LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW AND UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK HASTILY AND VIGOROUSLY AT THE CHURCH DOOR
4898-20016-0007 BUT HALF RECOVERED FROM HIS WONDER HE WAS JUST RAISING HIS VOICE TO UTTER A REMONSTRANCE WHEN TO HIS SEVENFOLD AMAZEMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THE KNOCK AND THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED WITHIN
4898-20016-0008 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A CREEPING FEELING OF AWE MINGLED WITH HIS ASTONISHMENT THAT NATHAN GAZED UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THIS SILENT FIGURE HAD VANISHED BUT HE WAS NOT EASILY TO BE DAUNTED
4898-20016-0009 HE DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE STRANGER INTO THE CHURCH BUT HE REMEMBERED A SHED SO PLACED AGAINST THE BUILDING NEAR THE FARTHER END THAT HE HAD OFTEN WHEN A CHILD AT SOME PERIL INDEED CLIMBED UPON ITS TOP
4898-20016-0010 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0011 IN ORDER TO GATHER WARMTH AND COURAGE FOR THE ATTEMPT WHEN NATHAN STODDARD CLIMBED UPON THE OLD SHED AND PRESSED HIS FACE AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE LITTLE CHURCH WINDOW HE HAD AT FIRST ONLY A CONFUSED IMPRESSION
4898-20016-0012 AS HE GLARED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO THE OLD KIRK OF ALLOWAY THE GREAT CHANDELIER OF THE CHURCH WAS PARTLY LIGHTED AND THERE WERE BESIDES MANY CANDLES AND LANTERNS BURNING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM
4898-20016-0013 WHO WERE DRESSED IN BREECHES AND RUFFLED SHIRTS AND HOOPED PETTICOATS AND TOWERING HEAD DRESSES SUCH AS HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN OLD PICTURES THEY WERE MOUNTED UPON BENCHES AND LADDERS
4898-20016-0014 AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
4898-20016-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
4898-20016-0016 IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
4898-20016-0017 THE MORE HE WAS FILLED FOR ALL THEIR APPEARANCE OF YOUTH AND THEIR SIMPLE MANNERS WITH A STRANGE SORT OF VENERATION THE SWEET AND CHEERFUL FACES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SEEMED TO GROW AWFULLY CALM
4898-20016-0018 AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
4898-20016-0019 ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S FACE HE APPEARED TO NATHAN AS IF HE FELT THAT THE GROUP BEFORE HIM ONLY WAITED HIS COMMAND TO FADE AWAY IN THE MORNING LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED AMONG THE CANDLES BUT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE THE WORD
4898-20016-0020 AND SO THEY KEPT PLAYING WITH THE FESTOONS AND STEPPING ABOUT THE PEWS TO PLEASE HIM NATHAN FELT A COLD THRILL PARTLY FROM PLEASURE AND PARTLY FROM AWE RUNNING UP HIS BACK AND A STRONG PAIN ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD
4898-20016-0021 UNTIL HE FELT THAT HE WAS NEAR SWOONING AND LIKE TO FALL AND HE CLUNG DESPERATELY TO HIS HOLD WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER HE DARED VENTURE NO MORE BUT HASTENED TO THE GROUND
4898-20016-0022 THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
4898-20016-0023 SO HE WENT BACK TO HIS SHOP AND SAT LOOKING UPON THE CHURCH AND WATCHING ALMOST WITH DREAD THE DOVES THAT LIGHTED UPON ITS ROOF AND FLUTTERED ABOUT AND BEAT THEIR WINGS AGAINST ITS WINDOWS
4898-20016-0024 THE MINISTER OF NATHAN'S PARISH WAS A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF DUDLEY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN OUT BEFORE LIGHT ON THE MORNING WE HAVE SPOKEN OF TO VISIT A SICK MAN AT SOME DISTANCE
4898-20016-0025 IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
4898-20016-0026 HE STOPPED HIS HORSE TO LISTEN
4898-20016-0027 AND DROVE ROUND INTO THE SQUARE TO THE SHOP OF NATHAN STODDARD THERE IS MUSIC TO DAY IN OUR CHURCH NATHAN HE CRIED TO THE YOUNG SADDLER WHAT CAN IT MEAN BUT NATHAN ANSWERED NOT A WORD HE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE HEAD
4898-20016-0028 AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
4898-20016-0029 AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
4898-20016-0030 SAID NATHAN NOT VENTURING A GLANCE HIMSELF MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED AND HAD NOT NATHAN'S ARM BEEN ABOUT HIS BODY HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOLD IN SHEER AMAZEMENT THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IT BEFORE
4898-20016-0031 AND CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHOM HIS EYE VERSED IN THE DRESS AND MANNERS OF OUR FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED AS THE CHURCH GOERS OF A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THE SINGERS GALLERY WAS FILLED BY A CHOIR OF GIRLS AND BOYS
4898-20016-0032 IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
4898-20016-0033 HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
4898-20016-0034 BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
4898-20016-0035 ROSE HIGH AND LOUD WHILE A GREAT THUNDERING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CHURCH ANNOUNCED THAT THE PEOPLE BELOW HAD ALSO CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AND WERE CLAMOROUS FOR ADMISSION
4898-20016-0036 MISTER DUDLEY HASTENED ROUND TO PREVENT THEIR CAUSING ANY DISTURBANCE TO THE CONGREGATION WITHIN BUT HE CAME ONLY IN TIME TO SEE THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND TO BE BORNE IN WITH THE CROWD ALL GAZED ABOUT IN WONDER
4898-20016-0037 HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
4898-20016-0038 HAD BEEN LEFT AT HIS DOOR BY A WHITE HAIRED OLD MAN DRESSED IN BLACK ABOUT SIX IN THE MORNING JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO VISIT HIS SICK PARISHIONER THE GIRL WHO RECEIVED IT REPORTED THE OLD MAN AS SAYING
4898-20016-0039 IN A TREMULOUS BUT VERY KIND VOICE GIVE YOUR MASTER THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING OF AN OLD PURITAN MINISTER HOW THE MEANING OF THIS MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISTER DUDLEY HAD NOT THE EVENTS WE HAVE TOLD DISCLOSED IT
4898-20016-0040 AND THAT HE AVOWS THE INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE CHRISTMAS OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR WITH PUBLIC SERVICES UNLESS INDEED HE SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED BY HIS ANCIENT PREDECESSOR
