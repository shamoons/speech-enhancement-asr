4898-28461-0000 THE MOST INTERESTING OF THE SHORT EXCURSIONS WE MADE FROM FORT WRANGELL WAS THE ONE UP THE STICKEEN RIVER TO THE HEAD OF STEAM NAVIGATION FROM MT SAINT ELIAS THE COAST RANGE EXTENDS IN A BROAD LOFTY CHAIN
4898-28461-0001 BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY GASHED BY STUPENDOUS CANYONS
4898-28461-0002 THOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SHORT AS THEIR HIGHEST SOURCES LIE IN THE ICY SOLITUDES OF THE RANGE WITHIN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES OF THE COAST A FEW HOWEVER OF THESE FOAMING ROARING STREAMS
4898-28461-0003 TAKU STICKEEN AND PERHAPS OTHERS HEAD BEYOND THE RANGE WITH SOME OF THE SOUTHWEST BRANCHES OF THE MACKENZIE AND YUKON THE LARGEST SIDE BRANCHES
4898-28461-0004 ARE STILL OCCUPIED BY GLACIERS WHICH DESCEND IN SHOWY RANKS THEIR MESSY BULGING SNOUTS LYING BACK A LITTLE DISTANCE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WALLS OR PUSHING FORWARD AMONG THE COTTON WOODS
4898-28461-0005 THAT LINE THE BANKS OF THE RIVERS OR EVEN STRETCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAIN CANYONS COMPELLING THE RIVERS TO FIND A CHANNEL BENEATH THEM THE STICKEEN WAS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE RIVERS THAT CROSS THE COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0006 BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO THE MACKENZIE RIVER CASSIAR GOLD MINES IT IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES LONG AND IS NAVIGABLE FOR SMALL STEAMERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO GLENORA
4898-28461-0007 AND SOMETIMES TO TELEGRAPH CREEK FIFTEEN MILES FARTHER IT FIRST PURSUES A WESTERLY COURSE THROUGH GRASSY PLAINS DARKENED HERE AND THERE WITH GROVES OF SPRUCE AND PINE
4898-28461-0008 THEN CURVING SOUTHWARD AND RECEIVING NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES FROM THE NORTH IT ENTERS THE COAST RANGE AND SWEEPS ACROSS IT THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT CANYON THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET DEEP
4898-28461-0009 OF FORM AND SCULPTURE AND ARE WONDERFULLY ADORNED AND ENLIVENED WITH GLACIERS AND WATERFALLS WHILE THROUGHOUT ALMOST ITS WHOLE EXTENT THE FLOOR IS A FLOWERY LANDSCAPE GARDEN LIKE YOSEMITE
4898-28461-0010 THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES ARE THE GLACIERS HANGING OVER THE CLIFFS DESCENDING THE SIDE CANYONS AND PUSHING FORWARD TO THE RIVER GREATLY ENHANCING THE WILD BEAUTY OF ALL THE OTHERS
4898-28461-0011 GLIDING ALONG THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER THE VIEWS CHANGE WITH BEWILDERING RAPIDITY WONDERFUL TOO ARE THE CHANGES DEPENDENT ON THE SEASONS AND THE WEATHER IN SPRING WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST
4898-28461-0012 YOU ENJOY THE COUNTLESS REJOICING WATERFALLS THE GENTLE BREATHING OF WARM WINDS THE COLORS OF THE YOUNG LEAVES AND FLOWERS WHEN THE BEES ARE BUSY AND WAFTS OF FRAGRANCE ARE DRIFTING HITHER AND THITHER
4898-28461-0013 FROM MILES OF WILD ROSES CLOVER AND HONEYSUCKLE THE SWATHS OF BIRCH AND WILLOW ON THE LOWER SLOPES FOLLOWING THE MELTING OF THE WINTER AVALANCHE SNOW BANKS
4898-28461-0014 THE BOSSY CUMULI SWELLING IN WHITE AND PURPLE PILES ABOVE THE HIGHEST PEAKS GRAY RAIN CLOUDS WREATHING THE OUTSTANDING BROWS AND BATTLEMENTS OF THE WALLS
4898-28461-0015 AND THE BREAKING FORTH OF THE SUN AFTER THE RAIN THE SHINING OF THE LEAVES AND STREAMS AND CRYSTAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE GLACIERS THE RISING OF FRESH FRAGRANCE THE SONG OF THE HAPPY BIRDS
4898-28461-0016 AND THE SERENE COLOR GRANDEUR OF THE MORNING AND EVENING SKY IN SUMMER YOU FIND THE GROVES AND GARDENS IN FULL DRESS GLACIERS MELTING RAPIDLY UNDER SUNSHINE AND RAIN WATERFALLS IN ALL THEIR GLORY
4898-28461-0017 THE RIVER REJOICING IN ITS STRENGTH YOUNG BIRDS TRYING THEIR WINGS BEARS ENJOYING SALMON AND BERRIES ALL THE LIFE OF THE CANYON BRIMMING FULL LIKE THE STREAMS IN AUTUMN COMES REST AS IF THE YEAR'S WORK WERE DONE
4898-28461-0018 THE RICH HAZY SUNSHINE STREAMING OVER THE CLIFFS CALLS FORTH THE LAST OF THE GENTIANS AND GOLDENRODS THE GROVES AND THICKETS AND MEADOWS BLOOM AGAIN AS THEIR LEAVES CHANGE TO RED AND YELLOW PETALS
4898-28461-0019 THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
4898-28461-0020 MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
4898-28461-0021 WE ARRIVED BEFORE NOON AT THE OLD TRADING POST CALLED BUCK'S IN FRONT OF THE STICKEEN GLACIER AND REMAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WISHED A NEARER VIEW TO CROSS THE RIVER TO THE TERMINAL MORAINE
4898-28461-0022 THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE ICE PINNACLES ALONG ITS TERMINAL WALL PRODUCED A WONDERFUL GLORY OF COLOR AND THE BROAD SPARKLING CRYSTAL PRAIRIE AND THE DISTANT SNOWY FOUNTAINS WERE WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE
4898-28461-0023 AND EXPANDS IN A BROAD FAN FIVE OR SIX MILES IN WIDTH SEPARATED FROM THE STICKEEN RIVER BY ITS BROAD TERMINAL MORAINE FRINGED WITH SPRUCES AND WILLOWS AROUND THE BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN CURVE OF THE MORAINE
4898-28461-0024 WAS ONCE UNITED FRONT TO FRONT WITH THE GREATER GLACIER THOUGH AT FIRST BOTH WERE TRIBUTARIES OF THE MAIN STICKEEN GLACIER WHICH ONCE FILLED THE WHOLE GRAND CANYON AFTER THE MAIN TRUNK CANYON WAS MELTED OUT
4898-28461-0025 CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
4898-28461-0026 WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
4898-28461-0027 BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
4898-28461-0028 AND HAD RECEDED TO A GREATER OR LESSER HEIGHT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS HARDLY OUT OF SIGHT ERE YOU COME UPON ANOTHER THAT POURS A MAJESTIC CRYSTAL FLOOD
4898-28461-0029 THROUGH THE EVERGREENS WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOLLOW AND TRIBUTARY CANYON CONTAINS A SMALLER ONE THE SIZE OF COURSE VARYING WITH THE EXTENT OF THE AREA DRAINED SOME ARE LIKE MERE SNOW BANKS OTHERS WITH THE BLUE ICE APPARENT
4898-28461-0030 DEPEND IN MASSIVE BULGING CURVES AND SWELLS AND GRADUATE INTO THE RIVER LIKE FORMS THAT MAZE THROUGH THE LOWER FORESTED REGIONS AND ARE SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY ARE ADMIRED EVEN BY THE PASSING MINERS
4898-28461-0031 WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
4898-28461-0032 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE IS A GROUP OF FIVE GLACIERS ONE OF THEM DESCENDING TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE RIVER NEAR GLENORA ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLANK OF THE MAIN COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0033 JUST BELOW A NARROW GORGE CALLED THE CANYON TERRACES FIRST MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE WHERE GREAT QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL HAVE BEEN SWEPT THROUGH THE FLOOD CHOKED GORGE AND OF COURSE OUTSPREAD
4898-28461-0034 AND DEPOSITED ON THE FIRST OPEN LEVELS BELOW HERE TOO OCCURS A MARKED CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN FORESTS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THE WOODS ARE YOUNGER
4898-28461-0035 AND ARE COMPOSED OF SMALLER TREES ABOUT A FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET HIGH MOSTLY TWO LEAVED PINES WHICH HOLD THEIR SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE RIPE THE WOODS HERE ARE WITHOUT A TRACE
4898-28461-0036 OF THOSE DEEP ACCUMULATIONS OF MOSSES LEAVES AND DECAYING TRUNKS WHICH MAKE SO DAMP AND UNCLEARABLE MASS IN THE COAST FORESTS
4898-28461-0037 WHERE THE FOREST HAS BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED THE RIVER BANK COTTONWOODS ARE ALSO SMALLER AND THE BIRCH AND CONTORTA PINES MINGLE FREELY WITH THE COAST HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE THE BIRCH IS COMMON ON THE LOWER SLOPES
4898-28461-0038 AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE ITS ROUND LEAFY PALE GREEN HEAD CONTRASTING WITH THE DARK NARROW SPIRES OF THE CONIFERS AND GIVING A STRIKING CHARACTER TO THE FOREST THE TAMARAC PINE OR BLACK PINE AS THE VARIETY OF
4898-28461-0039 WHERE IT HAS ESCAPED FIRE AND SNOW AVALANCHES THERE IS ANOTHER HANDSOME SPRUCE HEREABOUTS PICEA ALBA VERY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT DROOPING AT THE TOP LIKE A MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK
4898-28461-0040 I SAW FINE SPECIMENS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH ON DEEP BOTTOM LAND A FEW MILES BELOW GLENORA THE TOPS OF SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST COVERED WITH DENSE CLUSTERS OF YELLOW AND BROWN CONES
4898-28461-0041 WE REACHED THE OLD HUDSON'S BAY TRADING POST AT GLENORA ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP HERE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOULD MAKE AN EARLY START FOR WRANGELL
4898-28461-0042 AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES TO THE NORTHEASTWARD OF THE LANDING THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING GROUP OF MOUNTAINS CROWNING A SPUR FROM THE MAIN CHAIN OF THE COAST RANGE WHOSE HIGHEST POINT RISES ABOUT
4898-28461-0043 EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND AS GLENORA IS ONLY A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
4898-28461-0044 BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IT OCCUPIED FOR GENERAL VIEWS OF THE PEAKS AND GLACIERS OF THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT RANGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST THREE AND THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT
4898-28461-0045 I THOUGHT THAT BY RAPID CLIMBING I COULD REACH THE SUMMIT BEFORE SUNSET IN TIME TO GET A GENERAL VIEW AND A FEW PENCIL SKETCHES AND MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE STEAMER IN THE NIGHT MISTER YOUNG ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES ASKED PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
4898-28461-0046 A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A SEASONED MOUNTAINEER TO BE DONE IN LESS THAN HALF A DAY AND PART OF A NIGHT BUT HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A STRONG WALKER COULD DO A MOUNTAINEER'S DAY'S WORK IN HALF A DAY AND WOULD NOT HINDER ME IN ANY WAY
4898-28461-0047 WELL I HAVE WARNED YOU I SAID AND WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT MAY ARISE HE PROVED TO BE A STOUT WALKER AND WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS ACROSS A BRUSHY TIMBERED FLAT
4898-28461-0048 AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
4898-28461-0049 WHEN WE WERE NEAR A CLUSTER OF CRUMBLING PINNACLES THAT FORMED THE SUMMIT I HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT THE MOUNTAINEERING STRENGTH AND SKILL OF MY COMPANION AND PUSHED RAPIDLY ON IN PASSING AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHEST PINNACLE
4898-28461-0050 WHERE THE ROCK WAS RAPIDLY DISINTEGRATING AND THE DANGER OF SLIPPING WAS GREAT I SHOUTED IN A WARNING VOICE BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THIS IS DANGEROUS MISTER YOUNG WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN OR TWO YARDS BEHIND ME BUT OUT OF SIGHT
4898-28461-0051 I FOUND HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SUCH A PLACE I THEREFORE TIED HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES WITH MY SUSPENDERS AND NECKTIE TO PREVENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INFLAMMATION FROM MOVEMENT I THEN LEFT HIM TELLING HIM TO LIE STILL
4898-28461-0052 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0053 I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
4898-28461-0054 DUG HEEL NOTCHES AND SLID HIM DOWN TO THEM
4898-28461-0055 AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
4898-28461-0056 AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE OF HIS ARMS INTO PLACE
4898-28461-0057 I THEREFORE BOUND IT CLOSELY TO HIS SIDE AND ASKED HIM IF IN HIS EXHAUSTED AND TREMBLING CONDITION HE WAS STILL ABLE TO WALK YES HE BRAVELY REPLIED SO WITH A STEADYING ARM AROUND HIM AND MANY STOPS FOR REST
4898-28461-0058 I MARCHED HIM SLOWLY DOWN IN THE STARLIGHT ON THE COMPARATIVELY SMOOTH
4898-28461-0059 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
4898-28461-0060 AND A LEAFY BED BESIDE IT I NOW TOLD HIM I WOULD RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HASTEN BACK WITH HELP FROM THE BOAT AND CARRY HIM DOWN IN COMFORT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY LEAVING HIM NO NO HE SAID I CAN WALK DOWN DON'T LEAVE ME
4898-28461-0061 I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
4898-28461-0062 AND MADE HIM LEAN ON MY SHOULDER WHILE I STEADIED HIM TO PREVENT HIS FALLING THIS SLOW STAGGERING STRUGGLE FROM FIRE TO FIRE LASTED UNTIL LONG AFTER SUNRISE WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE SHIP AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW SINGLE PLANK
4898-28461-0063 AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE I BRIEFLY EXPLAINED TO MISTER YOUNG'S COMPANIONS WHO STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT US THAT HE HAD BEEN HURT IN AN ACCIDENT AND REQUESTED ONE OF THEM TO ASSIST ME IN GETTING HIM ABOARD BUT STRANGE TO SAY INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN TO HELP
4898-28461-0064 THEY MADE HASTE TO REPROACH HIM FOR HAVING GONE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH MUIR THESE FOOLISH ADVENTURES ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR MISTER MUIR THEY SAID BUT YOU MISTER YOUNG HAVE A WORK TO DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE A CHURCH
4898-28461-0065 AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RISK YOUR LIFE ON TREACHEROUS PEAKS AND PRECIPICES
4898-28461-0066 HAD BEEN SWEARING IN ANGRY IMPATIENCE FOR BEING COMPELLED TO MAKE SO LATE A START AND THUS ENCOUNTER A DANGEROUS WIND IN A NARROW GORGE AND WAS THREATENING TO PUT THE MISSIONARIES ASHORE TO SEEK THEIR LOST COMPANION
4898-28461-0067 WHILE HE WENT ON DOWN THE RIVER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN HE HEARD MY CALL FOR HELP HE HASTENED FORWARD AND ELBOWED THE DIVINES AWAY FROM THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SHOUTING IN ANGRY IRREVERENCE OH BLANK THIS IS NO TIME FOR PREACHING
4898-28461-0068 THEN WITH A MAN HOLDING DOWN HIS SHOULDERS WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE BONE INTO ITS SOCKET NOTWITHSTANDING THE INFLAMMATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS MISTER YOUNG WAS THEN PUT TO BED AND HE SLEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO WRANGELL
