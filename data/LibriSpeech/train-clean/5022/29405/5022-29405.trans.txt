5022-29405-0000 TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST READ IT AND CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE INTERVAL WHICH LEAVE ME FREE TO EXERCISE MY OWN DISCRETION AND TO LET THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SPEAK FOR ITSELF IF I AM ASKED WHAT IMPRESSION OF THE WRITER THOSE EXTRAORDINARY PAGES PRODUCED ON ME
5022-29405-0001 I FEEL AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY NOT ONE IMPRESSION BUT MANY IMPRESSIONS TROUBLED AND CONFUSED MY MIND CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE CONFESSION INCLINED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER WAS MAD BUT I ALTERED MY OPINION AT THE NEXT LEAF
5022-29405-0002 AND SET HIM DOWN AS A MAN WITH A BITTER HUMOR
5022-29405-0003 AT ONE TIME HIS TONE IN WRITING OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND HIS ALLUSIONS TO HIS MOTHER WON MY SYMPATHY AND RESPECT AT ANOTHER TIME THE PICTURE OF HIMSELF IN HIS LATER YEARS AND THE DEFIANT MANNER IN WHICH HE PRESENTED IT
5022-29405-0004 ALMOST MADE ME REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT DIED OF THE ILLNESS WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DEAF
5022-29405-0005 AT ONE POSITIVE CONCLUSION AS STRANGERS HE AND I HAD FIRST MET AS STRANGERS I WAS DETERMINED WE SHOULD REMAIN HAVING MADE UP MY MIND SO FAR THE NEXT THING TO DO WITH THE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL PIECE STRIKING MIDNIGHT WAS TO GO TO BED
5022-29405-0006 I SLEPT BADLY THE EVENTS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND HAD EXCITED ME I SUPPOSE NOW AND THEN IN THE WAKEFUL HOURS OF THE NIGHT I THOUGHT OF CRISTEL WITH SOME ANXIETY
5022-29405-0007 THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
5022-29405-0008 INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS DYING WITH CURIOSITY SHE HAD HEARD FROM THE SERVANTS THAT I HAD NOT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE UNTIL PAST TEN O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEWILDERED BY THE DISCOVERY WHAT COULD HER DEAR GERARD HAVE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE DARK BY HIMSELF
5022-29405-0009 FOR ALL THAT TIME FOR SOME PART OF THE TIME I ANSWERED I WAS CATCHING MOTHS IN FORDWITCH WOOD
5022-29405-0010 MISSUS ROYLAKE'S FASCINATING SMILE DISAPPEARED WHEN I MENTIONED THE MILL SHE SUDDENLY BECAME A COLD LADY I MIGHT EVEN SAY A STIFF LADY
5022-29405-0011 OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
5022-29405-0012 WAS IT A PLEASANT DINNER PARTY LAST NIGHT I ASKED AS IF THE SUBJECT REALLY INTERESTED ME I HAD NOT BEEN QUITE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS IN ENGLAND YET AND I WAS BECOMING A HUMBUG ALREADY
5022-29405-0013 MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
5022-29405-0014 I HAVE ASKED THE TWO LADIES MY LORD HAS AN ENGAGEMENT TO DINE HERE TO DAY WITHOUT CEREMONY THEY ARE MOST ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU MY DEAR GERARD YOU LOOK SURPRISED
5022-29405-0015 I WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY IGNORANCE MISSUS ROYLAKE WAS SHOCKED AT ANY RATE SHE RESUMED YOU HAVE HEARD OF THEIR FATHER LORD UPPERCLIFF I MADE ANOTHER SHAMEFUL CONFESSION
5022-29405-0016 EITHER I HAD FORGOTTEN LORD UPPERCLIFF DURING MY LONG ABSENCE ABROAD OR I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM
5022-29405-0017 WE WILL DRIVE OUT AFTER LUNCHEON AND PAY A ROUND OF VISITS WHEN THIS PROSPECT WAS PLACED BEFORE ME I REMEMBERED HAVING READ IN BOOKS OF SENSITIVE PERSONS RECEIVING IMPRESSIONS WHICH MADE THEIR BLOOD RUN COLD
5022-29405-0018 I MUST TELL YOU THAT LADY RACHEL IS THE ELDEST SHE IS MARRIED TO THE HONORABLE CAPTAIN MILLBAY OF THE NAVY NOW AWAY IN HIS SHIP A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF MIND I DON'T MEAN THE CAPTAIN I MEAN LADY RACHEL
5022-29405-0019 I ADMIRE HER INTELLECT BUT HER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL OPINIONS I MUST ALWAYS VIEW WITH REGRET
5022-29405-0020 IS SIMPLY THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN ENGLAND IF YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
5022-29405-0021 POOR SIR GEORGE SHE REFUSED HIM LAST WEEK YOU REALLY MUST HAVE HEARD OF SIR GEORGE OUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CONSERVATIVE OF COURSE QUITE BROKEN HEARTED ABOUT LADY LENA GONE AWAY TO AMERICA TO SHOOT BEARS
5022-29405-0022 YOU WANT TO SMOKE AFTER BREAKFAST WELL I WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY GO OUT ON THE TERRACE YOUR POOR FATHER ALWAYS TOOK HIS CIGAR ON THE TERRACE THEY SAY SMOKING LEADS TO MEDITATION I LEAVE YOU TO MEDITATE ON LADY LENA DON'T FORGET
5022-29405-0023 SHE SMILED AND KISSED HER HAND AND FLUTTERED OUT OF THE ROOM CHARMING PERFECTLY CHARMING AND YET I WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH MYSELF BACK IN GERMANY AGAIN I LIT MY CIGAR BUT NOT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29405-0024 LEAVING THE HOUSE I TOOK THE WAY ONCE MORE THAT LED TO FORDWITCH WOOD WHAT WOULD MISSUS ROYLAKE HAVE SAID IF SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO THE MILL THERE WAS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THE PORTFOLIO WAS A TRUST CONFIDED TO ME
5022-29405-0025 THE SOONER I RETURNED IT TO THE WRITER OF THE CONFESSION THE SOONER I TOLD HIM PLAINLY THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE MORE AT EASE MY MIND WOULD BE THE SLUGGISH RIVER LOOKED MUDDIER THAN EVER THE NEW COTTAGE LOOKED UGLIER THAN EVER
5022-29405-0026 I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
5022-29405-0027 HE STARED AT ME IN MOMENTARY PERPLEXITY AND SUDDENLY RECOVERING HIMSELF ASKED ME TO WALK IN ARE YOU THE YOUNG MASTER SIR AH YES YES I THOUGHT SO MY GIRL CRISTY SAID SHE SAW THE YOUNG MASTER LAST NIGHT THANK YOU KINDLY SIR I'M PRETTY WELL
5022-29405-0028 MY MEALS DON'T SHOW ON ME YOU WILL EXCUSE MY RECEIVING YOU IN THE KITCHEN SIR IT'S THE BEST ROOM WE HAVE DID CRISTY TELL YOU HOW BADLY WE ARE OFF HERE FOR REPAIRS YOU BEING OUR LANDLORD WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP US WE ARE FALLING TO PIECES AS IT WERE
5022-29405-0029 ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
5022-29405-0030 IN A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHOUT A BROWN DOG OF THE COMPANIONABLE RETRIEVER BREED RAN IN AND FAWNED UPON OLD TOLLER CRISTEL FOLLOWED FROM THE KITCHEN GARDEN WITH A BASKET OF VEGETABLES ON HER ARM
5022-29405-0031 I NOW SAW IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY THE LUSTER OF HER BROWN EYES THE WARM ROSINESS OF HER DARK COMPLEXION THE DELIGHTFUL VIVACITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS THE CROWNING CHARM OF HER FACE SHE PAUSED CONFUSEDLY IN THE DOORWAY
5022-29405-0032 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0033 MY ANSWER WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ASSUMED THE FORM OF A FOOLISH COMPLIMENT IF HER FATHER HAD NOT SPARED HER THAT INFLICTION
5022-29405-0034 HE SAYS ALL RIGHT AND HE DOES NOTHING THERE'S FIRST AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THE TRULY DREADFUL STATE OF THE DRAINS I TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO SPEAK TO THE BAILIFF MYSELF ON HEARING THIS GOOD NEWS MISTER TOLLER'S GRATITUDE BECAME UNGOVERNABLE
5022-29405-0035 HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
5022-29405-0036 HIS DAUGHTER INTERFERED AND STOPPED HIM AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING HIS ARM TO CONDUCT ME IN STATE ACROSS THE KITCHEN CRISTEL HAD JUST PUT HER PRETTY BROWN HAND OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID OH FATHER DO PRAY BE QUIET
5022-29405-0037 WHEN WE WERE ALL THREE DISTURBED BY ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATING AS I CONCLUDED FROM ITS POSITION WITH THE NEW COTTAGE WAS SUDDENLY OPENED IN THE INSTANT BEFORE THE PERSON BEHIND IT APPEARED THE DOG LOOKED THAT WAY
5022-29405-0038 STARTED UP FRIGHTENED AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE TABLE AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE DEAF LODGER WALKED INTO THE ROOM IT WAS HE BEYOND ALL DOUBT WHO HAD FRIGHTENED THE DOG FOREWARNED BY INSTINCT OF HIS APPEARANCE
5022-29405-0039 WHAT I HAD READ OF HIS WRITING DISPOSED ME NOW THAT I SAW THE MAN BY DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE NO STRONG AS IT WAS MY PREJUDICE FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISCOVERIES THAT PRESENTED HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
5022-29405-0040 HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS TRIUMPHED IN THE CLEAR SEARCHING LIGHT I NOW PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE OF THAT DEEPLY DARK BLUE WHICH IS COMMONLY AND FALSELY DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING THE COLOR OF THE VIOLET TO MY THINKING THEY WERE SO ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL
5022-29405-0041 THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE IN A MAN'S FACE
5022-29405-0042 TO THE SOFT PROFUSION OF HIS REDDISH BROWN HAIR TO HIS FINELY SHAPED SENSITIVE LIPS BUT FOR TWO MARKED PECULIARITIES IN HIM WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME TO BE WRONG THAT IS TO SAY THE EXPRESSION OF POWER ABOUT HIS HEAD
5022-29405-0043 AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
