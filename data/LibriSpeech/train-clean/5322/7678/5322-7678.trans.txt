5322-7678-0000 WHICH HAD RUN ON IN FRONT STARTED TWO PHEASANTS HE HAD HARDLY STEPPED AMONG THE BRIERS WHEN THE PHEASANTS BEGAN TO RISE AT EVERY STEP THE OLD MAN HAD NOT SHOWN HIM THAT PLACE THE DAY BEFORE AS HE MEANT TO KEEP IT FOR SHOOTING FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN
5322-7678-0001 OLENIN FIRED TWELVE TIMES AND KILLED FIVE PHEASANTS BUT CLAMBERING AFTER THEM THROUGH THE BRIERS HE GOT SO FATIGUED THAT HE WAS DRENCHED WITH PERSPIRATION HE CALLED OFF HIS DOG UNCOCKED HIS GUN
5322-7678-0002 PUT IN A BULLET ABOVE THE SMALL SHOT AND BRUSHING AWAY THE MOSQUITOES WITH THE WIDE SLEEVE OF HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT HE WENT SLOWLY TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP BACK THE DOG
5322-7678-0003 WHO FOUND TRAILS ON THE VERY PATH AND OLENIN KILLED TWO MORE PHEASANTS SO THAT AFTER BEING DETAINED BY THIS IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS NOON BEFORE HE BEGAN TO FIND THE PLACE HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE DAY WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR
5322-7678-0004 CALM AND HOT THE MORNING MOISTURE HAD DRIED UP EVEN IN THE FOREST AND MYRIADS OF MOSQUITOES LITERALLY COVERED HIS FACE HIS BACK AND HIS ARMS HIS DOG HAD TURNED FROM BLACK TO GREY
5322-7678-0005 ITS BACK BEING COVERED WITH MOSQUITOES AND SO HAD OLENIN'S COAT THROUGH WHICH THE INSECTS THRUST THEIR STINGS OLENIN WAS READY TO RUN AWAY FROM THEM AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE SUMMER
5322-7678-0006 HE WAS ABOUT TO GO HOME BUT REMEMBERING THAT OTHER PEOPLE MANAGED TO ENDURE SUCH PAIN HE RESOLVED TO BEAR IT AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BE DEVOURED AND STRANGE TO SAY BY NOONTIME THE FEELING BECAME ACTUALLY PLEASANT
5322-7678-0007 HE EVEN FELT THAT WITHOUT THIS MOSQUITO FILLED ATMOSPHERE AROUND HIM AND THAT MOSQUITO PASTE MINGLED WITH PERSPIRATION WHICH HIS HAND SMEARED OVER HIS FACE AND THAT UNCEASING IRRITATION ALL OVER HIS BODY
5322-7678-0008 THE FOREST WOULD LOSE FOR HIM SOME OF ITS CHARACTER AND CHARM THESE MYRIADS OF INSECTS WERE SO WELL SUITED TO THAT MONSTROUSLY LAVISH WILD VEGETATION THESE MULTITUDES OF BIRDS AND BEASTS WHICH FILLED THE FOREST
5322-7678-0009 THIS DARK FOLIAGE THIS HOT SCENTED AIR
5322-7678-0010 THESE RUNLETS FILLED WITH TURBID WATER WHICH EVERYWHERE SOAKED THROUGH FROM THE TEREK AND GURGLED HERE AND THERE UNDER THE OVERHANGING LEAVES THAT THE VERY THING WHICH HAD AT FIRST SEEMED TO HIM DREADFUL AND INTOLERABLE
5322-7678-0011 NOW SEEMED PLEASANT AFTER GOING ROUND THE PLACE WHERE YESTERDAY THEY HAD FOUND THE ANIMAL AND NOT FINDING ANYTHING HE FELT INCLINED TO REST
5322-7678-0012 HAVING FOUND THE TRACES OF YESTERDAY'S STAG HE CREPT UNDER A BUSH INTO THE THICKET JUST WHERE THE STAG HAD LAIN AND LAY DOWN IN ITS LAIR HE EXAMINED THE DARK FOLIAGE AROUND HIM
5322-7678-0013 THE PLACE MARKED BY THE STAG'S PERSPIRATION AND YESTERDAY'S DUNG THE IMPRINT OF THE STAG'S KNEES THE BIT OF BLACK EARTH IT HAD KICKED UP AND HIS OWN FOOTPRINTS OF THE DAY BEFORE HE FELT COOL AND COMFORTABLE
5322-7678-0014 AND DID NOT THINK OF OR WISH FOR ANYTHING
5322-7678-0015 SUDDENLY WITH EXTRAORDINARY CLEARNESS HE THOUGHT HERE AM I DMITRI OLENIN A BEING QUITE DISTINCT FROM EVERY OTHER BEING NOW LYING ALL ALONE HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHERE WHERE A STAG USED TO LIVE
5322-7678-0016 AN OLD STAG A BEAUTIFUL STAG WHO PERHAPS HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN AND IN A PLACE WHERE NO HUMAN BEING HAS EVER SAT OR THOUGHT THESE THOUGHTS HERE I SIT AND AROUND ME STAND OLD AND YOUNG TREES
5322-7678-0017 ONE OF THEM FESTOONED WITH WILD GRAPE VINES AND PHEASANTS ARE FLUTTERING DRIVING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT AND PERHAPS SCENTING THEIR MURDERED BROTHERS HE FELT HIS PHEASANTS EXAMINED THEM
5322-7678-0018 AND WIPED THE WARM BLOOD OFF HIS HAND ONTO HIS COAT PERHAPS THE JACKALS SCENT THEM AND WITH DISSATISFIED FACES GO OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ABOVE ME
5322-7678-0019 FLYING IN AMONG THE LEAVES WHICH TO THEM SEEM ENORMOUS ISLANDS MOSQUITOES HANG IN THE AIR AND BUZZ ONE TWO THREE FOUR
5322-7678-0020 A HUNDRED A THOUSAND A MILLION MOSQUITOES AND ALL OF THEM BUZZ SOMETHING OR OTHER AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS SEPARATE FROM ALL ELSE AND IS JUST SUCH A SEPARATE DMITRI OLENIN AS I AM MYSELF
5322-7678-0021 HE VIVIDLY IMAGINED WHAT THE MOSQUITOES BUZZED THIS WAY THIS WAY LADS HERE'S SOME ONE WE CAN EAT THEY BUZZED AND STUCK TO HIM AND IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN A MEMBER OF MOSCOW SOCIETY
5322-7678-0022 THE FRIEND AND RELATION OF SO AND SO AND SO AND SO BUT JUST SUCH A MOSQUITO OR PHEASANT OR DEER AS THOSE THAT WERE NOW LIVING ALL AROUND HIM JUST AS THEY JUST AS DADDY EROSHKA
5322-7678-0023 GRASS WILL GROW AND NOTHING MORE BUT WHAT THOUGH THE GRASS DOES GROW HE CONTINUED THINKING STILL I MUST LIVE AND BE HAPPY BECAUSE HAPPINESS IS ALL I DESIRE
5322-7678-0024 NEVER MIND WHAT I AM AN ANIMAL LIKE ALL THE REST ABOVE WHOM THE GRASS WILL GROW AND NOTHING MORE OR A FRAME IN WHICH A BIT OF THE ONE GOD HAS BEEN SET STILL I MUST LIVE IN THE VERY BEST WAY
5322-7678-0025 HOW THEN MUST I LIVE TO BE HAPPY AND WHY WAS I NOT HAPPY BEFORE AND HE BEGAN TO RECALL HIS FORMER LIFE AND HE FELT DISGUSTED WITH HIMSELF
5322-7678-0026 THOUGH HE NOW SAW THAT ALL THE WHILE HE REALLY NEEDED NOTHING FOR HIMSELF AND HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE FOLIAGE WITH THE LIGHT SHINING THROUGH IT AT THE SETTING SUN AND THE CLEAR SKY AND HE FELT JUST AS HAPPY AS BEFORE WHY AM I HAPPY
5322-7678-0027 AND WHAT USED I TO LIVE FOR THOUGHT HE HOW MUCH I EXACTED FOR MYSELF HOW I SCHEMED AND DID NOT MANAGE TO GAIN ANYTHING BUT SHAME AND SORROW AND THERE NOW I REQUIRE NOTHING TO BE HAPPY
5322-7678-0028 AND SUDDENLY A NEW LIGHT SEEMED TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM HAPPINESS IS THIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF HAPPINESS LIES IN LIVING FOR OTHERS THAT IS EVIDENT THE DESIRE FOR HAPPINESS IS INNATE IN EVERY MAN
5322-7678-0029 IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS THESE DESIRES THAT ARE ILLEGITIMATE BUT NOT THE NEED FOR HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DESIRES CAN ALWAYS BE SATISFIED DESPITE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT ARE THEY LOVE SELF SACRIFICE
5322-7678-0030 HE WAS SO GLAD AND EXCITED WHEN HE HAD DISCOVERED THIS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM NEW TRUTH THAT HE JUMPED UP AND BEGAN IMPATIENTLY SEEKING SOME ONE TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR TO DO GOOD TO AND TO LOVE
5322-7678-0031 WHEN HE HAD COME OUT INTO THE GLADE HE LOOKED AROUND HIM THE SUN WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE ABOVE THE TREE TOPS IT HAD GROWN COOLER AND THE PLACE SEEMED TO HIM QUITE STRANGE AND NOT LIKE THE COUNTRY ROUND THE VILLAGE EVERYTHING SEEMED CHANGED
5322-7678-0032 THE WEATHER AND THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST THE SKY WAS WRAPPED IN CLOUDS THE WIND WAS RUSTLING IN THE TREE TOPS AND ALL AROUND NOTHING WAS VISIBLE BUT REEDS AND DYING BROKEN DOWN TREES
5322-7678-0033 HE CALLED TO HIS DOG WHO HAD RUN AWAY TO FOLLOW SOME ANIMAL AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK AS IN A DESERT AND SUDDENLY HE WAS SEIZED WITH A TERRIBLE SENSE OF WEIRDNESS HE GREW FRIGHTENED
5322-7678-0034 HE REMEMBERED THE ABREKS AND THE MURDERS HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT AND HE EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT THAT AN ABREK WOULD SPRING FROM BEHIND EVERY BUSH AND HE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND HIS LIFE AND DIE OR BE A COWARD HE THOUGHT OF GOD
5322-7678-0035 AND OF THE FUTURE LIFE AS FOR LONG HE HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND ALL AROUND WAS THAT SAME GLOOMY STERN WILD NATURE AND IS IT WORTH WHILE LIVING FOR ONESELF THOUGHT HE
5322-7678-0036 WHEN AT ANY MOMENT YOU MAY DIE AND DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY GOOD AND SO THAT NO ONE WILL KNOW OF IT HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE HE FANCIED THE VILLAGE LAY OF HIS SHOOTING HE HAD NO FURTHER THOUGHT
5322-7678-0037 BUT HE FELT TIRED TO DEATH AND PEERED ROUND AT EVERY BUSH AND TREE WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION AND ALMOST WITH TERROR EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS LIFE
5322-7678-0038 AFTER HAVING WANDERED ABOUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME HE CAME UPON A DITCH DOWN WHICH WAS FLOWING COLD SANDY WATER FROM THE TEREK AND NOT TO GO ASTRAY ANY LONGER HE DECIDED TO FOLLOW IT
5322-7678-0039 HE WENT ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE DITCH WOULD LEAD HIM SUDDENLY THE REEDS BEHIND HIM CRACKLED HE SHUDDERED AND SEIZED HIS GUN AND THEN FELT ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
