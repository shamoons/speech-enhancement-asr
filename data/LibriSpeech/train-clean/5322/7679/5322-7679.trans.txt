5322-7679-0000 SUDDENLY IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SUN HAD SHONE INTO HIS SOUL HE HEARD RUSSIAN BEING SPOKEN AND ALSO HEARD THE RAPID SMOOTH FLOW OF THE TEREK AND A FEW STEPS FARTHER IN FRONT OF HIM SAW THE BROWN MOVING SURFACE OF THE RIVER
5322-7679-0001 WITH THE DIM COLOURED WET SAND OF ITS BANKS AND SHALLOWS THE DISTANT STEPPE THE CORDON WATCH TOWER OUTLINED ABOVE THE WATER A SADDLED AND HOBBLED HORSE AMONG THE BRAMBLES AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS OPENING OUT BEFORE HIM
5322-7679-0002 THE RED SUN APPEARED FOR AN INSTANT FROM UNDER A CLOUD AND ITS LAST RAYS GLITTERED BRIGHTLY ALONG THE RIVER OVER THE REEDS ON THE WATCH TOWER
5322-7679-0003 AND ON A GROUP OF COSSACKS AMONG WHOM LUKASHKA'S VIGOROUS FIGURE ATTRACTED OLENIN'S INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION OLENIN FELT THAT HE WAS AGAIN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE PERFECTLY HAPPY
5322-7679-0004 HE HAD COME UPON THE NIZHNI PROTOTSK POST ON THE TEREK OPPOSITE A PRO RUSSIAN TARTAR VILLAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER HE ACCOSTED THE COSSACKS BUT NOT FINDING AS YET ANY EXCUSE FOR DOING ANYONE A KINDNESS HE ENTERED THE HUT
5322-7679-0005 BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DIVERT THEM THAT EVENING SOME HOSTILE CHECHENS RELATIVES OF THE ABREK WHO HAD BEEN KILLED HAD COME FROM THE HILLS WITH A SCOUT TO RANSOM THE BODY
5322-7679-0006 AND THE COSSACKS WERE WAITING FOR THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER'S ARRIVAL FROM THE VILLAGE THE DEAD MAN'S BROTHER TALL AND WELL SHAPED WITH A SHORT CROPPED BEARD WHICH WAS DYED RED DESPITE HIS VERY TATTERED COAT AND CAP
5322-7679-0007 WAS CALM AND MAJESTIC AS A KING HIS FACE WAS VERY LIKE THAT OF THE DEAD ABREK HE DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AT ANYONE AND NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT THE DEAD BODY BUT SITTING ON HIS HEELS IN THE SHADE HE SPAT AS HE SMOKED HIS SHORT PIPE
5322-7679-0008 AND OCCASIONALLY UTTERED SOME FEW GUTTURAL SOUNDS OF COMMAND WHICH WERE RESPECTFULLY LISTENED TO BY HIS COMPANION HE WAS EVIDENTLY A BRAVE WHO HAD MET RUSSIANS MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE IN QUITE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTHING ABOUT THEM COULD ASTONISH OR EVEN INTEREST HIM
5322-7679-0009 OLENIN WAS ABOUT TO APPROACH THE DEAD BODY AND HAD BEGUN TO LOOK AT IT WHEN THE BROTHER LOOKING UP AT HIM FROM UNDER HIS BROWS WITH CALM CONTEMPT SAID SOMETHING SHARPLY AND ANGRILY
5322-7679-0010 THE SCOUT HASTENED TO COVER THE DEAD MAN'S FACE WITH HIS COAT OLENIN WAS STRUCK
5322-7679-0011 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HIM ASKING FROM WHAT VILLAGE HE CAME BUT THE CHECHEN SCARCELY GIVING HIM A GLANCE SPAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND TURNED AWAY
5322-7679-0012 OLENIN WAS SO SURPRISED AT THE CHECHEN NOT BEING INTERESTED IN HIM THAT HE COULD ONLY PUT IT DOWN TO THE MAN'S STUPIDITY OR IGNORANCE OF RUSSIAN SO HE TURNED TO THE SCOUT WHO ALSO ACTED AS INTERPRETER THE SCOUT WAS AS RAGGED AS THE OTHER
5322-7679-0013 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING RED HAIRED HE WAS BLACK HAIRED RESTLESS WITH EXTREMELY WHITE GLEAMING TEETH AND SPARKLING BLACK EYES THE SCOUT WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION AND ASKED FOR A CIGARETTE THERE WERE FIVE BROTHERS
5322-7679-0014 BEGAN THE SCOUT IN HIS BROKEN RUSSIAN THIS IS THE THIRD BROTHER THE RUSSIANS HAVE KILLED ONLY TWO ARE LEFT HE IS A BRAVE A GREAT BRAVE HE SAID POINTING TO THE CHECHEN

5322-7679-0016 LUKASHKA WENT UP TO THE SPEAKER AND SAT DOWN OF WHAT VILLAGE ASKED HE FROM THERE IN THE HILLS REPLIED THE SCOUT POINTING TO THE MISTY BLUISH GORGE BEYOND THE TEREK DO YOU KNOW SUUK SU IT IS ABOUT EIGHT MILES BEYOND THAT

5322-7679-0020 IT WAS AS IF THESE COSSACKS WERE PLAYING AT BEING SOLDIERS BUT THESE FORMALITIES SOON GAVE PLACE TO ORDINARY WAYS OF BEHAVIOUR AND THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A SMART COSSACK JUST LIKE THE OTHERS BEGAN SPEAKING FLUENTLY IN TARTAR TO THE INTERPRETER
5322-7679-0021 THEY FILLED IN SOME DOCUMENT GAVE IT TO THE SCOUT AND RECEIVED FROM HIM SOME MONEY THEN THEY APPROACHED THE BODY WHICH OF YOU IS LUKE GAVRILOV

5322-7679-0025 WHEN THE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO THE SKIFF THE BROTHER CHECHEN DESCENDED TO THE BANK THE COSSACKS INVOLUNTARILY STEPPED ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS HE JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND PUSHED OFF FROM THE BANK WITH HIS POWERFUL LEG AND NOW
5322-7679-0026 AS OLENIN NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THREW A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THE COSSACKS AND THEN ABRUPTLY ASKED HIS COMPANION A QUESTION THE LATTER ANSWERED SOMETHING AND POINTED TO LUKASHKA
5322-7679-0027 THE CHECHEN LOOKED AT HIM AND TURNING SLOWLY AWAY GAZED AT THE OPPOSITE BANK THAT LOOK EXPRESSED NOT HATRED BUT COLD CONTEMPT HE AGAIN MADE SOME REMARK WHAT IS HE SAYING OLENIN ASKED OF THE FIDGETY SCOUT

5322-7679-0029 GAZING AT THE OPPOSITE BANK HE WAS SO FULL OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THAT MOVED HIS CURIOSITY THE SCOUT STANDING UP AT ONE END OF THE SKIFF
5322-7679-0030 AND DIPPING HIS PADDLE NOW ON ONE SIDE NOW ON THE OTHER STEERED SKILFULLY WHILE TALKING INCESSANTLY THE SKIFF BECAME SMALLER AND SMALLER AS IT MOVED OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE STREAM THE VOICES BECAME SCARCELY AUDIBLE
5322-7679-0031 AND AT LAST STILL WITHIN SIGHT THEY LANDED ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WHERE THEIR HORSES STOOD WAITING THERE THEY LIFTED OUT THE CORPSE AND THOUGH THE HORSE SHIED LAID IT ACROSS ONE OF THE SADDLES
5322-7679-0032 MOUNTED AND RODE AT A FOOT PACE ALONG THE ROAD PAST A TARTAR VILLAGE FROM WHICH A CROWD CAME OUT TO LOOK AT THEM THE COSSACKS ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED AND JOVIAL LAUGHTER AND JOKES WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES
5322-7679-0033 THE CAPTAIN AND THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE ENTERED THE MUD HUT TO REGALE THEMSELVES LUKASHKA VAINLY STRIVING TO IMPART A SEDATE EXPRESSION TO HIS MERRY FACE SAT DOWN WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES BESIDE OLENIN AND WHITTLED AWAY AT A STICK
