5393-19218-0000 THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS A BLESSED NIGHT ABOVE ITS SHADOWS HEAVEN STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT OF MARIUS AND COSETTE THE DAY HAD BEEN ADORABLE
5393-19218-0001 IT HAD NOT BEEN THE GRAND FESTIVAL DREAMED BY THE GRANDFATHER A FAIRY SPECTACLE WITH A CONFUSION OF CHERUBIM AND CUPIDS OVER THE HEADS OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A MARRIAGE WORTHY TO FORM THE SUBJECT OF A PAINTING TO BE PLACED OVER A DOOR BUT IT HAD BEEN SWEET AND SMILING
5393-19218-0002 THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY FRANCE HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING
5393-19218-0003 ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS
5393-19218-0004 THE MOST SACRED OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LIFE MINGLED PELL MELL WITH THE TETE A TETE OF THE CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE AND THE MAID SERVANT OF THE INN IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS SCARF THE PRIEST
5393-19218-0005 OATHS TO THE NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS FRANCE DOES NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY
5393-19218-0006 AND RAINING DOWN ON THE POST CHAISE OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A HAIL STORM OF SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND OF WORN OUT SHOES IN MEMORY OF CHURCHILL
5393-19218-0007 WHICH BROUGHT HIM GOOD LUCK OLD SHOES AND SLIPPERS DO NOT AS YET FORM A PART OF OUR NUPTIAL CELEBRATIONS BUT PATIENCE AS GOOD TASTE CONTINUES TO SPREAD WE SHALL COME TO THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
5393-19218-0008 MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
5393-19218-0009 PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
5393-19218-0010 NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
5393-19218-0011 NOW WE NOTE THIS DETAIL FOR THE PURE SATISFACTION OF BEING EXACT IT CHANCED
5393-19218-0012 AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
5393-19218-0013 AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO JEAN VALJEAN HE CRUSHED THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND
5393-19218-0014 NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING M GILLENORMAND
5393-19218-0015 IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD SUPPLIED HIS PLACE WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE CHURCH ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT
5393-19218-0016 TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL AT THAT EPOCH
5393-19218-0017 WAS IN PROCESS OF REPAVING IT WAS BARRED OFF
5393-19218-0018 AND JEAN VALJEAN MARIUS STILL SEPARATED FROM HIS BETROTHED ACCORDING TO USAGE DID NOT COME UNTIL THE SECOND
5393-19218-0019 BECAME ENTANGLED IN A LONG PROCESSION OF VEHICLES WHICH FORMED AN ENDLESS CHAIN FROM THE MADELEINE TO THE BASTILLE AND FROM THE BASTILLE TO THE MADELEINE MASKERS ABOUNDED ON THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0020 MERRY ANDREW PANTALOON AND CLOWN PERSISTED IN THE GOOD HUMOR OF THAT WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE PARIS HAD DISGUISED ITSELF AS VENICE SUCH SHROVE TUESDAYS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN NOW A DAYS
5393-19218-0021 ANY ONE IN THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE POLICE SERGEANTS MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT
5393-19218-0022 THOSE TWO BROOKS OF CARRIAGES FLOWING THE ONE DOWN STREAM THE OTHER UP STREAM
5393-19218-0023 EMBLAZONED WITH COATS OF ARMS HELD THE MIDDLE OF THE WAY GOING AND COMING FREELY CERTAIN JOYOUS AND MAGNIFICENT TRAINS NOTABLY
5393-19218-0024 HAD THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN THIS GAYETY OF PARIS ENGLAND CRACKED HER WHIP LORD SEYMOUR'S POST CHAISE HARASSED BY A NICKNAME FROM THE POPULACE PASSED WITH GREAT NOISE IN THE DOUBLE FILE ALONG WHICH THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS GALLOPED LIKE SHEEP DOGS
5393-19218-0025 HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE PUBLIC MIRTH
5393-19218-0026 ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE LINE THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0027 NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO AT THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF MASKERS
5393-19218-0028 ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS IF THEY WERE MISSING ON A SHROVE TUESDAY OR AT THE MID LENT IT WOULD BE TAKEN IN BAD PART AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THAT PROBABLY THE MINISTRY IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A CHANGE
5393-19218-0029 TOW WIGS PINK TIGHTS DANDIFIED HATS SPECTACLES OF A GRIMACER
5393-19218-0030 TORMENTED WITH A BUTTERFLY SHOUTS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS FISTS ON HIPS BOLD ATTITUDES BARE SHOULDERS IMMODESTY UNCHAINED A CHAOS OF SHAMELESSNESS DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
5393-19218-0031 THIS IS WHAT THAT INSTITUTION WAS LIKE GREECE STOOD IN NEED OF THE CHARIOT OF THESPIS FRANCE STANDS IN NEED OF THE HACKNEY COACH OF VADE EVERYTHING CAN BE PARODIED EVEN PARODY THE SATURNALIA
5393-19218-0032 DISPLAYING HER MARBLE BREAST IN A DIVINE SEMI NUDITY HAVING AT THE PRESENT DAY LOST HER SHAPE UNDER THE SOAKED RAGS OF THE NORTH HAS FINALLY COME TO BE CALLED THE JACK PUDDING THE TRADITION OF CARRIAGE LOADS OF MASKERS RUNS BACK TO THE MOST ANCIENT DAYS OF THE MONARCHY
5393-19218-0033 ALLOT TO THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE TWENTY SOUS TOURNOIS FOR THREE COACHES OF MASCARADES IN THE CROSS ROADS IN OUR DAY THESE NOISY HEAPS OF CREATURES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE THEMSELVES DRIVEN IN SOME ANCIENT CUCKOO CARRIAGE WHOSE IMPERIAL THEY LOAD DOWN
5393-19218-0034 OR THEY OVERWHELM A HIRED LANDAU WITH ITS TOP THROWN BACK WITH THEIR TUMULTUOUS GROUPS TWENTY OF THEM RIDE IN A CARRIAGE INTENDED FOR SIX THEY CLING TO THE SEATS TO THE RUMBLE ON THE CHEEKS OF THE HOOD ON THE SHAFTS
5393-19218-0035 ENRICHED WITH SLANG THIS CARRIAGE WHICH HAS BECOME COLOSSAL THROUGH ITS FREIGHT HAS AN AIR OF CONQUEST UPROAR REIGNS IN FRONT TUMULT BEHIND PEOPLE VOCIFERATE SHOUT HOWL

5393-19218-0037 THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN THERE ONE LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC WOMEN IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL OF GAYETY
5393-19218-0038 THAT BY PILING IGNOMINY UPON OPPROBRIUM THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTICED THAT THE SYSTEM OF SPYING AND SERVING AS CARYATIDS TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD AMUSE THE RABBLE WHEN IT CONFRONTS THEM
5393-19218-0039 THAT THE CROWD LOVES TO BEHOLD THAT MONSTROUS LIVING PILE OF TINSEL RAGS HALF DUNG HALF LIGHT ROLL BY ON FOUR WHEELS HOWLING AND LAUGHING THAT THEY SHOULD CLAP THEIR HANDS AT THIS GLORY COMPOSED OF ALL SHAMES
5393-19218-0040 THE LAUGHTER OF ALL IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE AND POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
5393-19218-0041 THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS PART OF POLITICS PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
5393-19218-0042 SHE ONLY DEMANDS OF HER MASTERS WHEN SHE HAS MASTERS ONE THING PAINT ME THE MUD ROME WAS OF THE SAME MIND SHE LOVED NERO NERO WAS A TITANIC LIGHTERMAN
5393-19218-0043 THAT ONE OF THESE SHAPELESS CLUSTERS OF MASKED MEN AND WOMEN DRAGGED ABOUT ON A VAST CALASH SHOULD HALT ON THE LEFT OF THE BOULEVARD WHILE THE WEDDING TRAIN HALTED ON THE RIGHT THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKS

5393-19218-0046 AND THE TWO MASKERS WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN HAD TO FACE THE THRONG WITH THEIR COMRADES AND DID NOT FIND THE ENTIRE REPERTORY OF PROJECTILES OF THE FISHMARKETS TOO EXTENSIVE TO RETORT TO THE ENORMOUS VERBAL ATTACKS OF THE POPULACE A FRIGHTFUL EXCHANGE OF METAPHORS TOOK PLACE
