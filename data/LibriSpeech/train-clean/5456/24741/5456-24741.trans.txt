5456-24741-0000 THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES
5456-24741-0001 PROOF ALL THE MODES IN WHICH ANY GIVEN BODY IS AFFECTED
5456-24741-0002 WHEREFORE THEIR IDEA ALSO NECESSARILY
5456-24741-0003 THEREFORE THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0004 HENCE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THE NATURE OF A VARIETY OF BODIES TOGETHER WITH THE NATURE OF ITS OWN
5456-24741-0005 IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA OF THE MODE AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
5456-24741-0006 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA WHICH DOES NOT EXCLUDE BUT POSTULATES THE EXISTENCE OR PRESENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0007 WILL REGARD THE EXTERNAL BODY AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
5456-24741-0008 COROLLARY THE MIND IS ABLE TO REGARD AS PRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED EVEN THOUGH THEY BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE OR PRESENT
5456-24741-0009 BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE THE MIND WILL NEVERTHELESS REGARD THEM AS PRESENT AS OFTEN AS THIS ACTION OF THE BODY IS REPEATED
5456-24741-0010 NOTE WE THUS SEE HOW IT COMES ABOUT
5456-24741-0011 THE LATTER INDICATES RATHER THE DISPOSITION OF PAUL'S BODY THAN THE NATURE OF PETER AND THEREFORE WHILE THIS DISPOSITION OF PAUL'S BODY LASTS PAUL'S MIND WILL REGARD PETER AS PRESENT TO ITSELF EVEN THOUGH HE NO LONGER EXISTS FURTHER TO RETAIN THE USUAL PHRASEOLOGY
5456-24741-0012 THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY OF WHICH THE IDEAS REPRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES AS PRESENT TO US WE WILL CALL THE IMAGES OF THINGS THOUGH THEY DO NOT RECALL THE FIGURE OF THINGS WHEN THE MIND REGARDS BODIES IN THIS FASHION WE SAY THAT IT IMAGINES
5456-24741-0013 LOOKED AT IN THEMSELVES DO NOT CONTAIN ERROR THE MIND DOES NOT ERR IN THE MERE ACT OF IMAGINING BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT IS REGARDED AS BEING WITHOUT THE IDEA
5456-24741-0014 WHICH ASSOCIATION ARISES IN THE MIND ACCORDING TO THE ORDER AND ASSOCIATION OF THE MODIFICATIONS AFFECTIONES OF THE HUMAN BODY I SAY FIRST IT IS AN ASSOCIATION OF THOSE IDEAS ONLY
5456-24741-0015 IDEAS OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE STRICTLY SPEAKING
5456-24741-0016 THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
5456-24741-0017 IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THAT ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS
5456-24741-0018 WHEREBY THE MIND PERCEIVES THINGS THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY CAUSES
5456-24741-0019 AND HENCE WE CAN FURTHER CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE MIND FROM THE THOUGHT OF ONE THING SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER THING WHICH HAS NO SIMILARITY WITH THE FIRST FOR INSTANCE FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE WORD POMUM AN APPLE
5456-24741-0020 A ROMAN WOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FRUIT APPLE WHICH HAS NO SIMILITUDE WITH THE ARTICULATE SOUND IN QUESTION NOR ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH IT
5456-24741-0021 THAT IS THAT THE MAN HAS OFTEN HEARD THE WORD POMUM WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT
5456-24741-0022 OR THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THOSE MODIFICATIONS
5456-24741-0023 THE HUMAN BODY ITSELF AND AS ACTUALLY EXISTING THEREFORE THE MIND PERCEIVES THUS FAR ONLY THE HUMAN BODY
5456-24741-0024 FOLLOWING IN GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AND BEING REFERRED TO GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE IDEA OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY PROOF
