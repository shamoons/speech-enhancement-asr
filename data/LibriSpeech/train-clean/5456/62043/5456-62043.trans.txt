5456-62043-0000 A BULLY BOAT AND A BRAG CAPTAIN A STORY OF STEAMBOAT LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI BY SOL SMITH DOES ANY ONE REMEMBER THE CARAVAN SHE WAS WHAT WOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED A SLOW BOAT THEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
5456-62043-0001 SHE WAS REGULARLY ADVERTISED AS THE FAST RUNNING ET CETERA HER REGULAR TRIPS FROM NEW ORLEANS TO NATCHEZ WERE USUALLY MADE IN FROM SIX TO EIGHT DAYS A TRIP MADE BY HER IN FIVE DAYS WAS CONSIDERED REMARKABLE
5456-62043-0002 A VOYAGE FROM NEW ORLEANS TO VICKSBURG AND BACK INCLUDING STOPPAGES GENERALLY ENTITLED THE OFFICERS AND CREW TO A MONTH'S WAGES WHETHER THE CARAVAN EVER ACHIEVED THE FEAT OF A VOYAGE TO THE FALLS LOUISVILLE I HAVE NEVER LEARNED IF SHE DID
5456-62043-0003 SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TIME OF IT IT WAS MY FATE TO TAKE PASSAGE IN THIS BOAT THE CAPTAIN WAS A GOOD NATURED EASY GOING MAN CAREFUL OF THE COMFORT OF HIS PASSENGERS AND EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THE GAME OF BRAG WE HAD BEEN OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS
5456-62043-0004 AND WE WERE IN HOPES OF SEEING THE BLUFFS OF NATCHEZ ON THE NEXT DAY OUR WOOD WAS GETTING LOW AND NIGHT COMING ON THE PILOT ON DUTY ABOVE THE OTHER PILOT HELD THREE ACES AT THE TIME AND WAS JUST CALLING OUT THE CAPTAIN WHO WENT IT STRONG ON THREE KINGS
5456-62043-0005 SENT DOWN WORD THAT THE MATE HAD REPORTED THE STOCK OF WOOD REDUCED TO HALF A CORD THE WORTHY CAPTAIN EXCUSED HIMSELF TO THE PILOT WHOSE WATCH WAS BELOW AND THE TWO PASSENGERS WHO MADE UP THE PARTY AND HURRIED TO THE DECK
5456-62043-0006 WHICH HE SAID WAS SITUATED RIGHT ROUND YONDER POINT BUT MUTTERED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T MUCH LIKE TO TAKE WOOD OF THE YELLOW FACED OLD SCOUNDREL WHO OWNS IT HE ALWAYS CHARGES A QUARTER OF A DOLLAR MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE HOWEVER THERE'S NO OTHER CHANCE
5456-62043-0007 AND IN A LITTLE LESS THAN AN HOUR WHEN OUR FUEL WAS ABOUT GIVING OUT WE MADE THE POINT AND OUR CABLES WERE OUT AND FASTENED TO TREES ALONGSIDE OF A GOOD SIZED WOOD PILE HALLO COLONEL HOW D'YE SELL YOUR WOOD THIS TIME A YELLOW FACED OLD GENTLEMAN
5456-62043-0008 WITH A TWO WEEKS BEARD STRINGS OVER HIS SHOULDERS HOLDING UP TO HIS ARMPITS A PAIR OF COPPERAS COLORED LINSEY WOOLSEY PANTS THE LEGS OF WHICH REACHED A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE KNEE SHOES WITHOUT STOCKINGS A FADED BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN BLACK
5456-62043-0009 AND A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH CASTING A GLANCE AT THE EMPTY GUARDS OF OUR BOAT AND UTTERING A GRUNT AS HE ROSE FROM FASTENING OUR SPRING LINE ANSWERED WHY CAPTING WE MUST CHARGE YOU THREE AND A QUARTER THIS TIME THE D L REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
5456-62043-0010 WHAT'S THE ODD QUARTER FOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOU ONLY CHARGED ME THREE AS I WENT DOWN WHY CAPTAING DRAWLED OUT THE WOOD MERCHANT WITH A SORT OF LEER ON HIS YELLOW COUNTENANCE WHICH CLEARLY INDICATED THAT HIS WOOD WAS AS GOOD AS SOLD
5456-62043-0011 WOOD'S RIZ SINCE YOU WENT DOWN TWO WEEKS AGO BESIDES YOU ARE AWAR THAT YOU VERY SELDOM STOP GOING DOWN
5456-62043-0012 AND THERE'S NO OTHER WOODYARD FOR NINE MILES AHEAD AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE NEARLY OUT OF FOOEL WHY WELL WELL INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN WE'LL TAKE A FEW CORDS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GAME OF BRAG
5456-62043-0013 IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE FELT THE CARAVAN COMMENCE PADDLING AGAIN SUPPER WAS OVER
5456-62043-0014 SITUATED ALONGSIDE AND OVERLOOKING THE BRAG TABLE WHERE THE CAPTAIN WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED HAVING NOW THE OTHER PILOT AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT WE JOGGED ON QUIETLY AND SEEMED TO BE GOING AT A GOOD RATE
5456-62043-0015 HOW DOES THAT WOOD BURN INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN OF THE MATE WHO WAS LOOKING ON AT THE GAME TISN'T OF MUCH ACCOUNT I RECKON ANSWERED THE MATE IT'S COTTONWOOD AND MOST OF IT GREEN AT THAT WELL THOMPSON THREE ACES AGAIN STRANGER
5456-62043-0016 THOMPSON I SAY WE'D BETTER TAKE THREE OR FOUR CORDS AT THE NEXT WOODYARD IT CAN'T BE MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM HERE TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER WITH THE AGE
5456-62043-0017 THE GAME WENT ON AND THE PADDLES KEPT MOVING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CAPTAIN THAT WE WERE NEARING THE WOODYARD THE LIGHT BEING DISTINCTLY SEEN BY THE PILOT ON DUTY HEAD HER IN SHORE THEN AND TAKE IN SIX CORDS IF IT'S GOOD SEE TO IT THOMPSON
5456-62043-0018 I CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE THE GAME NOW IT'S GETTING RIGHT WARM THIS PILOT'S BEATING US ALL TO SMASH THE WOODING COMPLETED WE PADDLED ON AGAIN THE CAPTAIN SEEMED SOMEWHAT VEXED WHEN THE MATE INFORMED HIM THAT THE PRICE WAS THE SAME AS AT THE LAST WOODYARD
5456-62043-0019 THREE AND A QUARTER BUT SOON AGAIN BECAME INTERESTED IN THE GAME FROM MY UPPER BERTH THERE WERE NO STATE ROOMS THEN I COULD OBSERVE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLAYERS
5456-62043-0020 THE LATTER PERSONAGES TOOK IT TURN AND TURN ABOUT STEERING AND PLAYING BRAG ONE OF THEM ALMOST INVARIABLY WINNING WHILE THE TWO PASSENGERS MERELY WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF DEALING CUTTING AND PAYING UP THEIR ANTIES THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE GAME
5456-62043-0021 AND THEY DID LEARN IT ONCE IN A WHILE INDEED SEEING THEY HAD TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER THEY WOULD VENTURE A BET OF FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS COMPELLED TO BACK OUT BEFORE THE TREMENDOUS BRAGGING OF THE CAPTAIN OR PILOT
5456-62043-0022 OR IF THEY DID VENTURE TO CALL OUT ON TWO BULLITS AND A BRAGGER THEY HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO FIND ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAD THE SAME KIND OF A HAND AND WERE MORE VENERABLE STILL WITH ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY CONTINUED PLAYING
5456-62043-0023 THEY WANTED TO LEARN THE GAME AT TWO O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN ASKED THE MATE HOW WE WERE GETTING ON OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING
5456-62043-0024 THIS WOOD SEEMS RATHER BETTER THAN THAT WE TOOK IN AT YELLOW FACE'S BUT WE'RE NEARLY OUT AGAIN AND MUST BE LOOKING OUT FOR MORE I SAW A LIGHT JUST AHEAD ON THE RIGHT SHALL WE HAIL YES YES REPLIED THE CAPTAIN RING THE BELL AND ASK EM WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD UP HERE I'VE GOT YOU AGAIN

5456-62043-0027 WAS THE REPLY OF THE YOUTHFUL SALESMAN THE CAPTAIN HERE TOLD THOMPSON TO TAKE SIX CORDS WHICH WOULD LAST TILL DAYLIGHT AND AGAIN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE GAME THE PILOTS HERE CHANGED PLACES WHEN DID THEY SLEEP WOOD TAKEN IN
5456-62043-0028 THE CARAVAN AGAIN TOOK HER PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM PADDLING ON AS USUAL DAY AT LENGTH DAWNED THE BRAG PARTY BROKE UP AND SETTLEMENTS WERE BEING MADE DURING WHICH OPERATION
5456-62043-0029 THE CAPTAIN'S BRAGGING PROPENSITIES WERE EXERCISED IN CRACKING UP THE SPEED OF HIS BOAT WHICH BY HIS RECKONING
5456-62043-0030 IT APPEARS THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THEIR FIRST LESSON HAD INCIDENTALLY LOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THE CAPTAIN AS HE ROSE TO SEE ABOUT TAKING IN SOME GOOD WOOD WHICH HE FELT SURE OF OBTAINING NOW THAT HE HAD GOT ABOVE THE LEVEL COUNTRY WINKED AT HIS OPPONENT
5456-62043-0031 THE PILOT WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN ON VERY BAD TERMS DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME AND SAID IN AN UNDERTONE FORTY APIECE FOR YOU AND I AND JAMES THE OTHER PILOT IS NOT BAD FOR ONE NIGHT I HAD RISEN AND WENT OUT WITH THE CAPTAIN TO ENJOY A VIEW OF THE BLUFFS
5456-62043-0032 THERE WAS JUST FOG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE VISION TAKING IN MORE THAN SIXTY YARDS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN MY EXPECTATION WE WERE NEARING THE SHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR WOOD THE BANKS BEING INVISIBLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN STOP HER
5456-62043-0033 AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD
