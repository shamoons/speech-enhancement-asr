5514-19192-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER
5514-19192-0001 HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
5514-19192-0002 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0003 WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND HEROIC TIME
5514-19192-0004 IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS HAD THEIR PALADINS THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
5514-19192-0005 THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT EXTREMELY SERIOUS
5514-19192-0006 IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
5514-19192-0007 THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
5514-19192-0008 SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
5514-19192-0009 SOME OF THE SWORD LIKE FANNICOT OTHERS OF THE PEN LIKE HENRI FONFREDE CIVILIZATION UNFORTUNATELY REPRESENTED AT THIS EPOCH RATHER BY AN AGGREGATION OF INTERESTS THAN BY A GROUP OF PRINCIPLES WAS OR THOUGHT ITSELF IN PERIL
5514-19192-0010 IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
5514-19192-0011 A PLATOON OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD CONSTITUTE ITSELF ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY A PRIVATE COUNCIL OF WAR AND JUDGE AND EXECUTE A CAPTURED INSURGENT IN FIVE MINUTES IT WAS AN IMPROVISATION OF THIS SORT THAT HAD SLAIN JEAN PROUVAIRE FIERCE LYNCH LAW
5514-19192-0012 WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
5514-19192-0013 WAS PURSUED IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS
5514-19192-0014 THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
5514-19192-0015 AND HAD SHOUTED DEATH ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED
5514-19192-0016 OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD PLEASURE THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS
5514-19192-0017 A SORT OF CONDOTTIERE OF THE ORDER OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST CHARACTERIZED A FANATICAL AND INTRACTABLE GOVERNMENTALIST COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FIRE PREMATURELY
5514-19192-0018 AND THE AMBITION OF CAPTURING THE BARRICADE ALONE AND UNAIDED THAT IS TO SAY WITH HIS COMPANY EXASPERATED BY THE SUCCESSIVE APPARITION OF THE RED FLAG AND THE OLD COAT WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE BLACK FLAG HE LOUDLY BLAMED THE GENERALS AND CHIEFS OF THE CORPS
5514-19192-0019 AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THEM FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
5514-19192-0020 HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS SAID HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
5514-19192-0021 THIS MOVEMENT EXECUTED WITH MORE GOOD WILL THAN STRATEGY COST THE FANNICOT COMPANY DEAR BEFORE IT HAD TRAVERSED TWO THIRDS OF THE STREET IT WAS RECEIVED BY A GENERAL DISCHARGE FROM THE BARRICADE FOUR THE MOST AUDACIOUS WHO WERE RUNNING ON IN FRONT
5514-19192-0022 WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
5514-19192-0023 THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES
5514-19192-0024 AND IT RECEIVED THE VOLLEY FROM THE BATTERY PIECE WHICH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE ORDER HAD NOT DISCONTINUED ITS FIRING THE INTREPID AND IMPRUDENT FANNICOT WAS ONE OF THE DEAD FROM THIS GRAPE SHOT HE WAS KILLED BY THE CANNON THAT IS TO SAY BY ORDER
5514-19192-0025 THIS ATTACK WHICH WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN SERIOUS
5514-19192-0026 THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
5514-19192-0027 INSURRECTION AND REPRESSION DO NOT FIGHT WITH EQUAL WEAPONS INSURRECTION WHICH IS SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED HAS ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHOTS TO FIRE AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COMBATANTS TO EXPEND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE BOX A MAN KILLED CANNOT BE REPLACED
5514-19192-0028 AS REPRESSION HAS THE ARMY IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS MEN AND AS IT HAS VINCENNES IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS SHOTS REPRESSION HAS AS MANY REGIMENTS AS THE BARRICADE HAS MEN AND AS MANY ARSENALS AS THE BARRICADE HAS CARTRIDGE BOXES
5514-19192-0029 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0030 THEN EVERYTHING RISES THE PAVEMENTS BEGIN TO SEETHE POPULAR REDOUBTS ABOUND PARIS QUIVERS SUPREMELY THE QUID DIVINUM IS GIVEN FORTH A TENTH OF AUGUST IS IN THE AIR A TWENTY NINTH OF JULY IS IN THE AIR
5514-19192-0031 A WONDERFUL LIGHT APPEARS THE YAWNING MAW OF FORCE DRAWS BACK AND THE ARMY THAT LION SEES BEFORE IT ERECT AND TRANQUIL THAT PROPHET FRANCE CHAPTER THIRTEEN
5514-19192-0032 PASSING GLEAMS IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION
5514-19192-0033 THE RAGE OF THE GAMBLER AND ABOVE ALL INTERMITTENCES OF HOPE ONE OF THESE INTERMITTENCES ONE OF THESE VAGUE QUIVERS OF HOPE SUDDENLY TRAVERSED THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED LISTEN
5514-19192-0034 WHO WAS STILL ON THE WATCH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PARIS IS WAKING UP IT IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE INSURRECTION BROKE OUT AFRESH FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
5514-19192-0035 REANIMATED SOME FANCIES BARRICADES WERE BEGUN IN THE RUE DU POIRIER AND THE RUE DES GRAVILLIERS IN FRONT OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A RIFLE ATTACKED ALONE A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
5514-19192-0036 IN PLAIN SIGHT ON THE OPEN BOULEVARD HE PLACED ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND SHOULDERED HIS WEAPON FIRED KILLED THE COMMANDER OF THE SQUADRON AND TURNED AWAY SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER WHO WILL DO US NO MORE HARM HE WAS PUT TO THE SWORD
5514-19192-0037 THE SLATS OF THE BLIND COULD BE SEEN TO TREMBLE AT EVERY SHOT A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS ARRESTED IN THE RUE DE LA COSSONERIE WITH HIS POCKETS FULL OF CARTRIDGES MANY POSTS WERE ATTACKED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE BERTIN POIREE
5514-19192-0038 A VERY LIVELY AND UTTERLY UNEXPECTED FUSILLADE WELCOMED A REGIMENT OF CUIRRASSIERS AT WHOSE HEAD MARCHED MARSHAL GENERAL CAVAIGNAC DE BARAGUE IN THE RUE PLANCHE MIBRAY THEY THREW OLD PIECES OF POTTERY AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS
5514-19192-0039 DOWN ON THE SOLDIERS FROM THE ROOFS A BAD SIGN
5514-19192-0040 AS HE RECALLED SUCHET'S SAYING AT SARAGOSSA
5514-19192-0041 THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF
5514-19192-0042 ALL THIS TAKEN TOGETHER DISTURBED THE MILITARY CHIEFS
5514-19192-0043 THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE
5514-19192-0044 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BARRICADES ONLY AND BE ABLE TO FINISH THEM AT ONE BLOW COLUMNS WERE THROWN INTO THE STREETS WHERE THERE WAS FERMENTATION SWEEPING THE LARGE SOUNDING THE SMALL RIGHT AND LEFT NOW SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY NOW AT FULL CHARGE
5514-19192-0045 THE TROOPS BROKE IN THE DOORS OF HOUSES WHENCE SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE SAME TIME
5514-19192-0046 THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
5514-19192-0047 MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WOUNDED MEN PASSING THE END OF THE STREET IN LITTERS AND HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC
5514-19192-0048 THEIR HOPE DID NOT LAST LONG THE GLEAM WAS QUICKLY ECLIPSED IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR WHAT WAS IN THE AIR VANISHED IT WAS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING UNACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER AND THE INSURGENTS FELT THAT SORT OF LEADEN COPE
5514-19192-0049 WHICH THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE CASTS OVER OBSTINATE AND DESERTED MEN FALL OVER THEM ONCE MORE THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ASSUMED A VAGUE OUTLINE HAD MISCARRIED AND THE ATTENTION OF THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE STRATEGY OF THE GENERALS
5514-19192-0050 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
