5514-19193-0009 THE PLATOON FIRING OF THE LINE AND OF THE SOLDIERS FROM THE SUBURBS SUSTAINED THE ARTILLERY ANOTHER CANNONADE WAS AUDIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE TWO GUNS WERE FURIOUSLY ATTACKING THE REDOUBT FROM THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
5514-19193-0010 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0011 THE OTHER BALLS THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0012 THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS AND
5514-19193-0013 FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT

5514-19193-0015 THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH BLINDING SMOKE AND AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES ATHWART THIS MIST ALL STREAKED WITH FLAME TWO THIRDS OF THE GUNNERS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LYING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE CANNONS
5514-19193-0016 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS SUCCESS
5514-19193-0017 ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS SUCCESS AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY CARTRIDGES LEFT IN THE BARRICADE IT APPEARS THAT GAVROCHE OVERHEARD THIS REMARK CHAPTER FIFTEEN GAVROCHE OUTSIDE
5514-19193-0018 COURFEYRAC SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME ONE AT THE BASE OF THE BARRICADE OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AMID THE BULLETS GAVROCHE HAD TAKEN A BOTTLE BASKET FROM THE WINE SHOP HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH THE CUT AND WAS QUIETLY ENGAGED IN EMPTYING
5514-19193-0019 THE FULL CARTRIDGE BOXES OF THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SLOPE OF THE REDOUBT INTO HIS BASKET WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ASKED COURFEYRAC GAVROCHE RAISED HIS FACE I'M FILLING MY BASKET CITIZEN DON'T YOU SEE THE GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0020 GAVROCHE REPLIED WELL IT IS RAINING WHAT THEN COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
5514-19193-0021 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
5514-19193-0022 THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES
5514-19193-0023 IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE THE COMBATANTS COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SHORT AS IT WAS
5514-19193-0024 THIS OBSCURITY WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DESIRED AND CALCULATED ON BY THE COMMANDERS WHO WERE TO DIRECT THE ASSAULT ON THE BARRICADE WAS USEFUL TO GAVROCHE BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THIS VEIL OF SMOKE AND THANKS TO HIS SMALL SIZE
5514-19193-0025 HE RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO ANOTHER
5514-19193-0026 AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A NUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
5514-19193-0027 FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
5514-19193-0028 AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
5514-19193-0029 FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD OVERTURNED HIS BASKET
5514-19193-0030 IT WAS A CHARMING AND TERRIBLE SIGHT GAVROCHE THOUGH SHOT AT WAS TEASING THE FUSILLADE HE HAD THE AIR OF BEING GREATLY DIVERTED IT WAS THE SPARROW PECKING AT THE SPORTSMEN TO EACH DISCHARGE HE RETORTED WITH A COUPLET
5514-19193-0031 THEY AIMED AT HIM CONSTANTLY AND ALWAYS MISSED HIM THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AS THEY TOOK AIM AT HIM HE LAY DOWN SPRANG TO HIS FEET HID IN THE CORNER OF A DOORWAY THEN MADE A BOUND DISAPPEARED RE APPEARED SCAMPERED AWAY RETURNED
5514-19193-0032 REPLIED TO THE GRAPE SHOT WITH HIS THUMB AT HIS NOSE AND ALL THE WHILE WENT ON PILLAGING THE CARTOUCHES EMPTYING THE CARTRIDGE BOXES AND FILLING HIS BASKET THE INSURGENTS PANTING WITH ANXIETY FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR EYES THE BARRICADE TREMBLED HE SANG
5514-19193-0033 HE WAS NOT A CHILD HE WAS NOT A MAN HE WAS A STRANGE GAMIN FAIRY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE INVULNERABLE DWARF OF THE FRAY THE BULLETS FLEW AFTER HIM HE WAS MORE NIMBLE THAN THEY HE PLAYED A FEARFUL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK WITH DEATH
5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5514-19193-0035 GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN
