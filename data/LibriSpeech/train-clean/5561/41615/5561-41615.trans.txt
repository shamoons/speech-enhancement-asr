5561-41615-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN A WOULD BE LARK
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0002 AND AS THE MORNING ADVANCED THEY BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE WIND SEVERAL TIMES THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER BEING STEALTHILY PASSED FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BUT AS TO ITS CONTENTS THEY HAD NO IDEA AS IT WAS NOT HANDED TO ANY ONE OF THEM
5561-41615-0003 AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
5561-41615-0004 ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
5561-41615-0005 HERE COMES MABEL SAID JESSICA MAYBE SHE HAS SEEN THE PAPER
5561-41615-0006 MABEL NODDED WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT MABEL ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY MABEL LOOKED DISTRESSED FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SAID
5561-41615-0007 BUT I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR BEFORE I READ IT THAT I WOULDN'T MENTION THE CONTENTS TO ANY ONE THEN OF COURSE WE WON'T ASK YOU SAID ANNE PIERSON QUICKLY BUT TELL US THIS MUCH IS IT ABOUT ANY OF US NO REPLIED MABEL IT ISN'T IT IS SOMETHING I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0008 AND DID YOU SIGN IT ASKED JESSICA I CERTAINLY DID NOT RESPONDED MABEL IT WAS SHE STOPPED THEN FLUSHED
5561-41615-0009 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE SECRETS AND NOT TELL YOU
5561-41615-0010 WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL IF IT DOESN'T CONCERN US WE DON'T CARE DO WE GIRLS NO INDEED WAS THE REPLY JUST THEN THE BELL SOUNDED AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS WITH THE RIDDLE STILL UNSOLVED
5561-41615-0011 ON WEDNESDAY ASIDE FROM A LITTLE MORE WHISPERING AND SIGNIFICANT GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THE PUPILS NOT A RIPPLE DISTURBED THE CALM OF THE STUDY HALL IT WAS THEREFORE A DISTINCT AND NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN MISS THOMPSON WALKED INTO THE ROOM
5561-41615-0012 DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
5561-41615-0013 AND THEN SHE LOOKED TOWARD GRACE WHOSE STEADY GRAY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PRINCIPAL'S FACE WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION I DON'T BELIEVE GRACE IS GUILTY AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MISS THOMPSON THEN SHE ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLED GIRLS SOMETHING HAS COME TO MY EARS GIRLS SAID THE PRINCIPAL
5561-41615-0014 THAT I FIND HARD TO CREDIT BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE THIS AFTERNOON I MUST KNOW WHO IS INNOCENT AND WHO IS GUILTY MISS THOMPSON PAUSED AND A NUMBER OF GIRLS STIRRED UNEASILY IN THEIR SEATS WHILE A FEW GLANCED QUICKLY TOWARD ELEANOR WHO WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THE PICTURE OF INNOCENCE
5561-41615-0015 THAT IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR ANY PUPIL TO ABSENT HERSELF FROM SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CIRCUS MATINEE OR ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS NATURE I HAVE SO SEVERELY DISCIPLINED PUPILS FOR THIS OFFENCE THAT FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE HAS DISOBEYED ME
5561-41615-0016 I WAS THEREFORE ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT A NUMBER OF GIRLS REGARDLESS OF RULES HAVE TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND HAVE DECIDED TO ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM SCHOOL TO MORROW IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE MATINEE TO BE GIVEN IN THE THEATRE
5561-41615-0017 SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0020 GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0023 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE BUT WAS REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU MAY BE SEATED THE GIRL WHO COMPOSED AND WROTE THAT AGREEMENT WILL NOW RISE AND EXPLAIN HERSELF WITHOUT HESITATING ELEANOR ROSE AND REGARDED THE PRINCIPAL WITH AN INSOLENT SMILE
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0026 IF YOU HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOUR POSSESSION BRING IT TO ME AT ONCE AND NEVER ANSWER ME AGAIN AS YOU DID JUST NOW YOU ARE BOTH DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPERTINENT BUT MISS THOMPSON'S ANGER TOWARD ELEANOR WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TEMPEST THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAD AROUSED IN ELEANOR
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0032 THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLICATED IN THIS MATTER ARE DISMISSED SHE SAID ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GIRLS AROSE AND PREPARED TO LEAVE THE STUDY HALL THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEING AMONG THE NUMBER
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0035 SHE DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE EIGHT GIRLS WERE SAFELY OUTSIDE THE STUDY HALL DOOR HURRY UP SHE SAID WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE SCHOOL DON'T STOP FOR A MINUTE IF MISS THOMPSON NOTICES THAT WE ARE GONE SHE'LL SEND AFTER US
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0038 I SUPPOSE IT DID LOOK AS THOUGH I TOLD YOU GIRLS SAID MABEL ALLISON WHO HAD JOINED THEM AT THE GATE YOU KNOW I WAS WITH YOU AT RECESS RIGHT AFTER THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED TO ME
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0041 NO SAID GRACE SHORTLY SHE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED THE THINGS SHE SAID TO MISS THOMPSON WERE DISGRACEFUL AND I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR THE WAY SHE SPOKE OF US I WOULDN'T SAY THAT GRACE REMARKED ANNE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0044 AND THE TERROR OF SUSPENSION AROSE IN MORE THAN ONE MIND AS THEY LISTENED TO HER SCATHING REMARKS
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0047 DO YOU INTEND TO OBEY ME MISS SAVELL ASKED MISS THOMPSON STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER VERY WELL CONTINUED MISS THOMPSON YOUR SILENCE INDICATES THAT YOU ARE STILL INSUBORDINATE YOU MAY THEREFORE CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THINGS
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
