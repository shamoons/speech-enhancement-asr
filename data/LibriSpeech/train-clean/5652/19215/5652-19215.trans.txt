5652-19215-0000 EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING THE DOCTOR ON BEING CONSULTED DECLARED THAT IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY IT WAS THEN DECEMBER A FEW RAVISHING WEEKS OF PERFECT HAPPINESS PASSED
5652-19215-0001 THE GRANDFATHER WAS NOT THE LEAST HAPPY OF THEM ALL HE REMAINED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT A TIME GAZING AT COSETTE THE WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE EXCLAIMED AND SHE HAS SO SWEET AND GOOD AN AIR
5652-19215-0002 SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
5652-19215-0003 MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
5652-19215-0004 THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
5652-19215-0005 JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
5652-19215-0006 AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
5652-19215-0007 A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
5652-19215-0008 PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
5652-19215-0009 OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
5652-19215-0010 SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
5652-19215-0011 THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
5652-19215-0012 AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
5652-19215-0013 BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
5652-19215-0014 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0015 THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
5652-19215-0016 A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0018 NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
5652-19215-0019 DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE
5652-19215-0020 PARURES IN ANTIQUE GOLDSMITH'S WORK IVORY BON BON BOXES ORNAMENTED WITH MICROSCOPIC BATTLES GEWGAWS AND RIBBONS HE LAVISHED EVERYTHING ON COSETTE COSETTE AMAZED
5652-19215-0021 HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
5652-19215-0022 WITH WINGS OF MECHLIN LACE THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
5652-19215-0023 EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO COSETTE ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS BLISS SAID
5652-19215-0024 THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE AGES LIKE CATO
5652-19215-0025 THANKS MARIUS THAT IS PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS

5652-19215-0027 I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK
5652-19215-0028 WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
5652-19215-0029 EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
5652-19215-0030 IT IGNORES THE NOBLE IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR
5652-19215-0031 FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET EBONY AND CALICO MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR

5652-19215-0038 THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
5652-19215-0039 ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED
5652-19215-0040 THAT GREAT BRAZEN HELMET OF TEN POINTS WHY DID ACHILLES AND HECTOR HEW EACH OTHER UP WITH VAST BLOWS OF THEIR LANCES BECAUSE HELEN ALLOWED PARIS TO TAKE HER GARTER WITH COSETTE'S GARTER
5652-19215-0041 HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
5652-19215-0042 AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
5652-19215-0043 GAMACHO ENTERED BUT IN SOOTH THE STOMACH IS AN AGREEABLE BEAST WHICH DEMANDS ITS DUE AND WHICH WANTS TO HAVE ITS WEDDING ALSO
5652-19215-0044 ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
5652-19215-0045 OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
5652-19215-0046 PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
5652-19215-0047 THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
5652-19215-0048 ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE IS A PRUDE
5652-19215-0049 YOUR CENTURY IS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE GRACES AS BEING TOO LOW IN THE NECK ALAS BEAUTY IS CONCEALED AS THOUGH IT WERE UGLINESS SINCE THE REVOLUTION
5652-19215-0050 EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
5652-19215-0051 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS GREAT BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN
5652-19215-0052 WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
5652-19215-0053 YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
5652-19215-0054 BE ONE OF THE GODS AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS GAMES AND LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
5652-19215-0055 THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
5652-19215-0056 DO NOT PRUNE THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM THE WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
5652-19215-0057 RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
5652-19215-0058 CORRESPONDS TO A COLD IN THE HEAD YOU SMELL NOTHING OF LIFE NEITHER ANY BAD NOR ANY GOOD ODOR MOREOVER THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD SETTLED THE ELDERLY SPINSTER'S INDECISION
5652-19215-0059 SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
5652-19215-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM POOR SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR
5652-19215-0061 ONE OWES SOME CONSIDERATION TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE HER FORTUNE TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SINCE THEY DID NOT NEED IT
5652-19215-0062 THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
