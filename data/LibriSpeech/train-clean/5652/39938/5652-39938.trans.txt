5652-39938-0000 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
5652-39938-0001 THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
5652-39938-0002 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0004 THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
5652-39938-0005 WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
5652-39938-0006 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0007 WILL SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN AND ACCORDINGLY HIS EXAMINATION IS NOT OBLIGED TO TRAP THE PATIENT BUT SIMPLY TO GUIDE HIM TO IMPORTANT POINTS BUT THEN BEGINS THE MOST ESSENTIAL STUDY OF DIAGNOSTICAL DIFFERENTIATION
5652-39938-0008 WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
5652-39938-0009 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0010 NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
5652-39938-0011 IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
5652-39938-0012 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0013 THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
5652-39938-0014 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0016 EVERYTHING OUGHT TO DETERMINE THE CHOICE OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC STEPS AS IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ALL THOSE FACTORS BY ANY SUFFICIENT INQUIRY
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0018 IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
5652-39938-0019 THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
5652-39938-0020 MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
5652-39938-0021 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0022 IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
5652-39938-0023 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0025 IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
5652-39938-0026 GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
5652-39938-0027 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0028 ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
5652-39938-0029 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0031 OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
5652-39938-0032 WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
5652-39938-0033 IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
5652-39938-0034 THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FIND THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN A TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF IRRITATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGIES AND A MERE INTERRUPTION WHICH SIMPLY DAMAGES THE ACQUIRED RELATIVE ADJUSTMENT
5652-39938-0035 EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
5652-39938-0036 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0037 AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0039 IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
5652-39938-0040 THE WILD CHASE FOR LUXURY IN THE HIGHER CLASSES REENFORCED BY THE COMMERCIALISM OF OUR TIME THE HARD AND MONOTONOUS LABOR IN OUR MODERN MILLS AND MINES FOR THE LOWER CLASSES
5652-39938-0041 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0042 THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
5652-39938-0043 WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5652-39938-0044 EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0046 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
5652-39938-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0049 MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
5652-39938-0050 ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
5652-39938-0051 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0052 YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
5652-39938-0053 EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
5652-39938-0054 SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
5652-39938-0055 COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
5652-39938-0056 THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
5652-39938-0057 THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
5652-39938-0058 BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
5652-39938-0059 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0061 BY FAR THE BEST ALTERATION IS THEREFORE EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF INTERRUPTION NOT SIMPLY REST BUT NEW ENGAGEMENTS WHICH AWAKEN NEW INTERESTS AND STIMULATE NEGLECTED MENTAL FACTORS DISBURDENING THE OVER STRAINED ELEMENTS OF MENTAL LIFE
5652-39938-0062 THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
5652-39938-0063 TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
5652-39938-0064 IN THE SECOND PLACE COME GAMES AND SPORT WHICH MAY ENTER INTO THEIR RIGHT IF FATIGUE CAN BE AVOIDED HARMONIOUS JOYFUL COMPANY AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE DEPRESSING COMPANY OF THE SANITARIUMS WILL ADD ITS PLEASANTNESS
5652-39938-0065 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
