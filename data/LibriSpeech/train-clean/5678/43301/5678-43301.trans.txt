5678-43301-0000 IN HIS MASONIC INSIGNIA IT WAS HE WHO HAD GIVEN IMMENSE IMPETUS TO THAT SECRET MOVEMENT BY HIS DECLARATION IN THE HOUSE THAT THE KEY OF FUTURE PROGRESS AND BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE ORDER
5678-43301-0001 IT WAS THROUGH THIS ALONE THAT THE FALSE UNITY OF THE CHURCH WITH ITS FANTASTIC SPIRITUAL FRATERNITY COULD BE COUNTERACTED SAINT PAUL HAD BEEN RIGHT HE DECLARED IN HIS DESIRE TO BREAK DOWN THE PARTITION WALLS BETWEEN NATIONS
5678-43301-0002 AND WRONG ONLY IN HIS EXALTATION OF JESUS CHRIST THUS HE HAD PRELUDED HIS SPEECH ON THE POOR LAW QUESTION POINTING TO THE TRUE CHARITY THAT EXISTED AMONG MASONS APART FROM RELIGIOUS MOTIVE
5678-43301-0003 AND LOOKED OUT WITH CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT AT THE HUGE THRONG GATHERED TO HEAR HER SON SPEAK A PLATFORM WAS ERECTED ROUND THE BRONZE STATUE AT SUCH A HEIGHT THAT THE STATESMAN APPEARED TO BE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS THOUGH AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER ELEVATION
5678-43301-0004 AND THIS PLATFORM WAS HUNG WITH ROSES SURMOUNTED BY A SOUNDING BOARD AND SET WITH A CHAIR AND TABLE THE WHOLE SQUARE ROUND ABOUT WAS PAVED WITH HEADS AND RESONANT WITH SOUND THE MURMURS OF THOUSANDS OF VOICES
5678-43301-0005 OVERPOWERED NOW AND AGAIN BY THE CRASH OF BRASS AND THUNDER OF DRUMS AS THE BENEFIT SOCIETIES AND DEMOCRATIC GUILDS EACH HEADED BY A BANNER
5678-43301-0006 AND CONVERGED TOWARDS THE WIDE RAILED SPACE ABOUT THE PLATFORM WHERE ROOM WAS RESERVED FOR THEM THE WINDOWS ON EVERY SIDE WERE PACKED WITH FACES TALL STANDS WERE ERECTED ALONG THE FRONT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND SAINT MARTIN'S CHURCH
5678-43301-0007 GARDEN BEDS OF COLOUR BEHIND THE MUTE WHITE STATUES THAT FACED OUTWARDS ROUND THE SQUARE FROM BRAITHWAITE IN FRONT PAST THE VICTORIANS JOHN DAVIDSON JOHN BURNS AND THE REST ROUND TO HAMPDEN AND DE MONTFORT TOWARDS THE NORTH
5678-43301-0008 THE OLD COLUMN WAS GONE WITH ITS LIONS
5678-43301-0009 NOR THE LIONS TO THE NEW ART AND IN THEIR PLACE STRETCHED A WIDE PAVEMENT BROKEN BY SLOPES OF STEPS THAT LED UP TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY OVERHEAD THE ROOFS SHOWED CROWDED FRIEZES OF HEADS AGAINST THE BLUE SUMMER SKY
5678-43301-0010 NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS IT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE EVENING PAPERS WERE COLLECTED WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE PLATFORM BY NOON AS THE CLOCKS BEGAN TO TELL THE HOUR TWO FIGURES APPEARED FROM BEHIND THE STATUE AND CAME FORWARD AND IN AN INSTANT
5678-43301-0011 THE MURMURS OF TALK ROSE INTO CHEERING OLD LORD PEMBERTON CAME FIRST A GREY HAIRED UPRIGHT MAN WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN DENOUNCING THE HOUSE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER ON THE OCCASION OF ITS FALL OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND HIS SON HAD SUCCEEDED HIM WORTHILY
5678-43301-0012 AND IT WAS HE WHO WAS TO BE CHAIRMAN ON THIS AUSPICIOUS OCCASION BEHIND HIM CAME OLIVER BAREHEADED AND SPRUCE AND EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE HIS MOTHER AND WIFE COULD SEE HIS BRISK MOVEMENT
5678-43301-0013 THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THESE LONDONERS COULD SING IT WAS AS IF A GIANT VOICE HUMMED THE SONOROUS MELODY RISING TO ENTHUSIASM TILL THE MUSIC OF MASSED BANDS FOLLOWED IT AS A FLAG FOLLOWS A FLAG STICK THE HYMN WAS ONE COMPOSED TEN YEARS BEFORE
5678-43301-0014 AND ALL ENGLAND WAS FAMILIAR WITH IT OLD MISSUS BLAND LIFTED THE PRINTED PAPER MECHANICALLY TO HER EYES AND SAW THE WORDS THAT SHE KNEW SO WELL THE LORD THAT DWELLS IN EARTH AND SEA
5678-43301-0015 HAD BEEN COMPOSED WITH BOTH SKILL AND ARDOUR THEY HAD A RELIGIOUS RING THE UNINTELLIGENT CHRISTIAN COULD SING THEM WITHOUT A QUALM YET THEIR SENSE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THE OLD HUMAN CREED THAT MAN WAS ALL EVEN CHRIST'S WORDS THEMSELVES WERE QUOTED
5678-43301-0016 THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT WAS SAID LAY WITHIN THE HUMAN HEART AND THE GREATEST OF ALL GRACES WAS CHARITY SHE GLANCED AT MABEL AND SAW THAT THE GIRL WAS SINGING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WITH HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND'S DARK FIGURE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
5678-43301-0017 AND HIS THIN METALLIC VOICE PIPED A SENTENCE OR TWO ACROSS THE TINKLING SPLASH OF THE FOUNTAINS BEHIND HIM THEN HE STEPPED BACK AND OLIVER CAME FORWARD IT WAS TOO FAR FOR THE TWO TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID BUT MABEL SLIPPED A PAPER SMILING TREMULOUSLY
5678-43301-0018 INTO THE OLD LADY'S HAND AND HERSELF BENT FORWARD TO LISTEN OLD MISSUS BRAND LOOKED AT THAT TOO KNOWING THAT IT WAS AN ANALYSIS OF HER SON'S SPEECH AND AWARE THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR HIS WORDS
5678-43301-0019 OF THIS GREAT ANNIVERSARY THEN THERE CAME A RETROSPECT COMPARING THE OLD STATE OF ENGLAND WITH THE PRESENT FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SPEAKER SAID POVERTY WAS STILL A DISGRACE NOW IT WAS SO NO LONGER
5678-43301-0020 IT WAS IN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO POVERTY THAT THE DISGRACE OR THE MERIT LAY WHO WOULD NOT HONOUR A MAN WORN OUT IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY OR OVERCOME AT LAST BY CIRCUMSTANCES AGAINST WHICH HIS EFFORTS COULD NOT PREVAIL
5678-43301-0021 HE ENUMERATED THE REFORMS PASSED FIFTY YEARS BEFORE ON THIS VERY DAY BY WHICH THE NATION ONCE AND FOR ALL DECLARED THE GLORY OF POVERTY AND MAN'S SYMPATHY WITH THE UNFORTUNATE SO HE HAD TOLD THEM HE WAS TO SING THE PRAISE OF PATIENT POVERTY
5678-43301-0022 AND ITS REWARD AND THAT HE SUPPOSED TOGETHER WITH A FEW PERIODS ON THE REFORM OF THE PRISON LAWS WOULD FORM THE FIRST HALF OF HIS SPEECH THE SECOND PART WAS TO BE A PANEGYRIC OF BRAITHWAITE TREATING HIM AS THE PRECURSOR OF A MOVEMENT THAT EVEN NOW HAD BEGUN
5678-43301-0023 OLD MISSUS BRAND LEANED BACK IN HER SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER THE WINDOW WHERE THEY SAT HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR THEM TWO ARM CHAIRS FILLED THE SPACE BUT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THERE WERE OTHERS STANDING VERY SILENT NOW CRANING FORWARD WATCHING TOO WITH PARTED LIPS
5678-43301-0024 A COUPLE OF WOMEN WITH AN OLD MAN DIRECTLY BEHIND AND OTHER FACES VISIBLE AGAIN BEHIND THEM THEIR OBVIOUS ABSORPTION MADE THE OLD LADY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HER DISTRACTION AND SHE TURNED RESOLUTELY ONCE MORE TO THE SQUARE AH HE WAS WORKING UP NOW TO HIS PANEGYRIC
5678-43301-0025 THE TINY DARK FIGURE WAS BACK A YARD NEARER THE STATUE AND AS SHE LOOKED HIS HAND WENT UP AND HE WHEELED POINTING AS A MURMUR OF APPLAUSE DROWNED FOR AN INSTANT THE MINUTE RESONANT VOICE THEN AGAIN HE WAS FORWARD HALF CROUCHING FOR HE WAS A BORN ACTOR
5678-43301-0026 AND A STORM OF LAUGHTER RIPPLED ROUND THE THRONG OF HEADS SHE HEARD AN INDRAWN HISS BEHIND HER CHAIR AND THE NEXT INSTANT AN EXCLAMATION FROM MABEL WHAT WAS THAT THERE WAS A SHARP CRACK AND THE TINY GESTICULATING FIGURE STAGGERED BACK A STEP
5678-43301-0027 THE OLD MAN AT THE TABLE WAS UP IN A MOMENT AND SIMULTANEOUSLY A VIOLENT COMMOTION BUBBLED AND HEAVED LIKE WATER ABOUT A ROCK AT A POINT IN THE CROWD IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE RAILED SPACE WHERE THE BANDS WERE MASSED AND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE FRONT OF THE PLATFORM
