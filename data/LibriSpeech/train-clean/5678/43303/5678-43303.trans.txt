5678-43303-0000 MABEL REMEMBERED HER HUSBAND'S ADVICE TO WATCH AND FOR A FEW DAYS DID HER BEST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT ALARMED HER THE OLD LADY WAS A LITTLE QUIET PERHAPS BUT WENT ABOUT HER MINUTE AFFAIRS AS USUAL SHE ASKED THE GIRL TO READ TO HER SOMETIMES
5678-43303-0001 SHE PACKED HIS BAG WITH HER OWN HANDS SET OUT HIS FURS FOR THE SWIFT FLIGHT TO PARIS AND WAVED TO HIM FROM THE WINDOW AS HE WENT DOWN THE LITTLE PATH TOWARDS THE JUNCTION HE WOULD BE GONE THREE DAYS HE SAID IT WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THAT SHE FELL ILL
5678-43303-0002 AND MABEL RUNNING UPSTAIRS IN ALARM AT THE MESSAGE OF THE SERVANT FOUND HER RATHER FLUSHED AND AGITATED IN HER CHAIR IT IS NOTHING MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY TREMULOUSLY AND SHE ADDED THE DESCRIPTION OF A SYMPTOM OR TWO
5678-43303-0003 SHE WAS SINCERELY FOND OF THE OLD LADY AND HAD ALWAYS FOUND HER PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE A QUIET SORT OF DELIGHT THE EFFECT OF HER UPON THE MIND WAS AS THAT OF AN EASY CHAIR UPON THE BODY THE OLD LADY WAS SO TRANQUIL AND HUMAN
5678-43303-0004 SO ABSORBED IN SMALL EXTERNAL MATTERS SO REMINISCENT NOW AND THEN OF THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH SO UTTERLY WITHOUT RESENTMENT OR PEEVISHNESS
5678-43303-0005 SHE FOUND LESS DIFFICULTY IN CONTEMPLATING THE END OF A VIGOROUS SOUL FOR IN THAT CASE SHE IMAGINED A KIND OF ENERGETIC RUSH OF FORCE BACK INTO THE ORIGIN OF THINGS
5678-43303-0006 HER WHOLE POINT SO TO SPEAK LAY IN THE DELICATE LITTLE FABRIC OF PERSONALITY BUILT OUT OF FRAGILE THINGS INTO AN ENTITY FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE SUM OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE DEATH OF A FLOWER REFLECTED MABEL IS SADDER THAN THE DEATH OF A LION
5678-43303-0007 THE BREAKING OF A PIECE OF CHINA MORE IRREPARABLE THAN THE RUIN OF A PALACE IT IS SYNCOPE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE CAME IN SHE MAY DIE AT ANY TIME SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS THERE IS NO NEED TO TELEGRAPH FOR MISTER BRAND
5678-43303-0008 HE MADE A LITTLE DEPRECATING MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WILL DIE IT
5678-43303-0009 SHE ASKED NO NO SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS I SAID HE ADDED A WORD OR TWO OF ADVICE AS TO THE USE OF THE OXYGEN INJECTOR AND WENT AWAY THE OLD LADY WAS LYING QUIETLY IN BED WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AND PUT OUT A WRINKLED HAND
5678-43303-0010 WELL MY DEAR SHE ASKED IT IS JUST A LITTLE WEAKNESS MOTHER YOU MUST LIE QUIET AND DO NOTHING SHALL I READ TO YOU NO MY DEAR I WILL THINK A LITTLE IT WAS NO PART OF MABEL'S IDEA TO DUTY TO TELL HER THAT SHE WAS IN DANGER
5678-43303-0011 FOR THERE WAS NO PAST TO SET STRAIGHT NO JUDGE TO BE CONFRONTED DEATH WAS AN ENDING NOT A BEGINNING IT WAS A PEACEFUL GOSPEL AT LEAST IT BECAME PEACEFUL AS SOON AS THE END HAD COME
5678-43303-0012 SO THE GIRL WENT DOWNSTAIRS ONCE MORE WITH A QUIET LITTLE ACHE AT HER HEART THAT REFUSED TO BE STILL WHAT A STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL THING DEATH WAS SHE TOLD HERSELF THIS RESOLUTION OF A CHORD THAT HAD HUNG SUSPENDED FOR THIRTY FIFTY OR SEVENTY YEARS
5678-43303-0013 BACK AGAIN INTO THE STILLNESS OF THE HUGE INSTRUMENT THAT WAS ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF THOSE SAME NOTES WOULD BE STRUCK AGAIN WERE BEING STRUCK AGAIN EVEN NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD THOUGH WITH AN INFINITE DELICACY OF DIFFERENCE IN THE TOUCH
5678-43303-0014 BUT THAT PARTICULAR EMOTION WAS GONE IT WAS FOOLISH TO THINK THAT IT WAS SOUNDING ETERNALLY ELSEWHERE FOR THERE WAS NO ELSEWHERE SHE TOO HERSELF WOULD CEASE ONE DAY LET HER SEE TO IT THAT THE TONE WAS PURE AND LOVELY
5678-43303-0015 MISTER PHILLIPS ARRIVED THE NEXT MORNING AS USUAL JUST AS MABEL HAD LEFT THE OLD LADY'S ROOM AND ASKED NEWS OF HER SHE IS A LITTLE BETTER I THINK SAID MABEL SHE MUST BE VERY QUIET ALL DAY THE SECRETARY BOWED AND TURNED ASIDE INTO OLIVER'S ROOM
5678-43303-0016 WHERE A HEAP OF LETTERS LAY TO BE ANSWERED A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER AS MABEL WENT UPSTAIRS ONCE MORE SHE MET MISTER PHILLIPS COMING DOWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE FLUSHED UNDER HIS SALLOW SKIN MISSUS BRAND SENT FOR ME HE SAID SHE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK TO NIGHT
5678-43303-0017 HE WILL WILL HE NOT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MISTER BRAND SAID HE WOULD BE HERE FOR A LATE DINNER HE WILL REACH LONDON AT NINETEEN AND IS THERE ANY OTHER NEWS HE COMPRESSED HIS LIPS THERE ARE RUMOURS HE SAID MISTER BRAND WIRED TO ME AN HOUR AGO
5678-43303-0018 HE SEEMED MOVED AT SOMETHING AND MABEL LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT IT IS NOT EASTERN NEWS SHE ASKED HIS EYEBROWS WRINKLED A LITTLE
5678-43303-0019 SHE WAS NOT OFFENDED FOR SHE TRUSTED HER HUSBAND TOO WELL BUT SHE WENT ON INTO THE SICK ROOM WITH HER HEART BEATING THE OLD LADY TOO SEEMED EXCITED SHE LAY IN BED WITH A CLEAR FLUSH IN HER WHITE CHEEKS AND HARDLY SMILED AT ALL TO THE GIRL'S GREETING
5678-43303-0020 SAID MABEL OLD MISSUS BRAND LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY AN INSTANT BUT SAID NOTHING DON'T EXCITE YOURSELF MOTHER OLIVER WILL BE BACK TO NIGHT THE OLD LADY DREW A LONG BREATH DON'T TROUBLE ABOUT ME MY DEAR SHE SAID I SHALL DO VERY WELL NOW
5678-43303-0021 HE WILL BE BACK TO DINNER WILL HE NOT IF THE VOLOR IS NOT LATE NOW MOTHER ARE YOU READY FOR BREAKFAST MABEL PASSED AN AFTERNOON OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
5678-43303-0022 THE SECRETARY WHO BREAKFASTED WITH HER IN THE PARLOUR LOOKING ON TO THE GARDEN HAD APPEARED STRANGELY EXCITED HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD BE AWAY THE REST OF THE DAY MISTER OLIVER HAD GIVEN HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ALL DISCUSSION OF THE EASTERN QUESTION
5678-43303-0023 AND HE HAD GIVEN HER NO NEWS OF THE PARIS CONVENTION HE ONLY REPEATED THAT MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK THAT NIGHT THEN HE HAD GONE OF IN A HURRY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE OLD LADY SEEMED ASLEEP WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AFTERWARDS AND MABEL DID NOT LIKE TO DISTURB HER
5678-43303-0024 NEITHER DID SHE LIKE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SO SHE WALKED BY HERSELF IN THE GARDEN THINKING AND HOPING AND FEARING TILL THE LONG SHADOW LAY ACROSS THE PATH AND THE TUMBLED PLATFORM OF ROOFS WAS BATHED IN A DUSTY GREEN HAZE FROM THE WEST
5678-43303-0025 AS SHE CAME IN SHE TOOK UP THE EVENING PAPER BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS THERE EXCEPT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONVENTION WOULD CLOSE THAT AFTERNOON TWENTY O'CLOCK CAME BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OLIVER THE PARIS VOLOR SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AN HOUR BEFORE
5678-43303-0026 BUT MABEL STARING OUT INTO THE DARKENING HEAVENS HAD SEEN THE STARS COME OUT LIKE JEWELS ONE BY ONE
5678-43303-0027 OF COURSE SHE MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT THERE WAS NO DEPENDING ON ITS EXACT COURSE BUT SHE HAD SEEN IT A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE AND WONDERED UNREASONABLY WHY SHE HAD NOT SEEN IT NOW BUT SHE WOULD NOT SIT DOWN TO DINNER AND PACED UP AND DOWN IN HER WHITE DRESS
5678-43303-0028 TURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE WINDOW LISTENING TO THE SOFT RUSH OF THE TRAINS THE FAINT HOOTS FROM THE TRACK AND THE MUSICAL CHORDS FROM THE JUNCTION A MILE AWAY THE LIGHTS WERE UP BY NOW AND THE VAST SWEEP OF THE TOWNS LOOKED LIKE FAIRYLAND BETWEEN THE EARTHLY LIGHT
5678-43303-0029 AND THE HEAVENLY DARKNESS WHY DID NOT OLIVER COME OR AT LEAST LET HER KNOW WHY HE DID NOT ONCE SHE WENT UPSTAIRS MISERABLY ANXIOUS HERSELF TO REASSURE THE OLD LADY AND FOUND HER AGAIN VERY DROWSY HE IS NOT COME SHE SAID
5678-43303-0030 I DARE SAY HE MAY BE KEPT IN PARIS THE OLD FACE ON THE PILLOW NODDED AND MURMURED AND MABEL WENT DOWN AGAIN IT WAS NOW AN HOUR AFTER DINNER TIME OH THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE KEPT HIM
5678-43303-0031 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN LATER THAN THIS HE MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE VOLOR HE MEANT TO CATCH THE CONVENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROLONGED HE MIGHT BE EXHAUSTED AND THINK IT BETTER TO SLEEP IN PARIS AFTER ALL AND HAVE FORGOTTEN TO WIRE
5678-43303-0032 HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE WIRED TO MISTER PHILLIPS AND THE SECRETARY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE SHE WENT AT LAST HOPELESSLY TO THE TELEPHONE AND LOOKED AT IT THERE IT WAS THAT ROUND SILENT MONTH THAT LITTLE ROW OF LABELLED BUTTONS
5678-43303-0033 SHE HALF DECIDED TO TOUCH THEM ONE BY ONE AND INQUIRE WHETHER ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS HIS CLUB HIS OFFICE IN WHITEHALL MISTER PHILLIPS'S HOUSE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AND THE REST BUT SHE HESITATED TELLING HERSELF TO BE PATIENT
5678-43303-0034 OLIVER HATED INTERFERENCE AND HE WOULD SURELY SOON REMEMBER AND RELIEVE HER ANXIETY THEN EVEN AS SHE TURNED AWAY THE BELL RANG SHARPLY AND A WHITE LABEL FLASHED INTO SIGHT WHITEHALL SHE PRESSED THE CORRESPONDING BUTTON AND HER HAND SHAKING SO MUCH
5678-43303-0035 THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE RECEIVER TO HER EAR SHE LISTENED WHO IS THERE HER HEART LEAPED AT THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S VOICE TINY AND MINUTE ACROSS THE MILES OF WIRE I MABEL SHE SAID ALONE HERE
