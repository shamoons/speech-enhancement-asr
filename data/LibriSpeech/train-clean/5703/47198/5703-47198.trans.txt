5703-47198-0006 SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE FURTHER AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT WHILE SIR ARTHUR WAS THERE ON LEAVE IT WAS A LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN A CLERK'S HANDWRITING AND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION AS SHE TORE IT OPEN

5703-47198-0019 NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
5703-47198-0020 I OFTEN THINK THAT IF SHE HAD LIVED SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE NOW IF YOU PROMISED HER NOT TO ASK I WON'T ASK EITHER SAID JULIET LOYALLY BUT I HOPE THEY'LL TELL ME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WON'T IT IF THEY TELL ME WITHOUT MY ASKING
5703-47198-0021 I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK SAID SIR ARTHUR IT IS ABSURD THAT YOU SHOULD BE BOUND BY A PROMISE THAT I MADE AND YOU MAY BE SURE OF ONE THING YOUR ASKING OR YOUR NOT ASKING WON'T MAKE ANY ODDS TO FINDLAY AND INCE
5703-47198-0022 IF THEY MEAN TO TELL YOU THEY WILL AND IF THEY DON'T YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO GET IT OUT OF THEM AND WHEN SHALL I GO CRIED JULIET THEY SAY THEY WANT ME TO ANSWER IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW OH WELL I DON'T KNOW

5703-47198-0024 JULIET PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS I COULD NEVER FIND ANOTHER FATHER HALF AS NICE AS THE ONE I'VE GOT BUT YOU COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT SO MANY DAUGHTERS YOU KNOW SHE SMILED AT HIM MOCKINGLY YOU'RE LIKE THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
5703-47198-0025 YOU OUGHT TO SET UP A SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT MY ELDEST DAUGHTER HE REPLIED HALF SERIOUS STILL I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOUR REAL PARENTS HAVE DECIDED TO OWN UP TO YOU
5703-47198-0026 AT ALL EVENTS IF THEY DO NOT TURN OUT DESIRABLE I SHALL STILL BE HERE I HOPE SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LOSE ANYTHING BY TAKING THIS CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT LADY BYRNE CAME INTO THE ROOM
5703-47198-0027 THE LETTER WAS PRODUCED AGAIN AND SHE JOINED HEARTILY IN THE EXCITEMENT IT HAD CAUSED YOU HAD BETTER START ON MONDAY SHE SAID TO JULIET THAT WILL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS TO PACK
5703-47198-0028 ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HER ARTHUR SHE ADDED TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I WOULD LIKE A SHOT HE REPLIED BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY GET AWAY NEXT WEEK I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK ON HAND JUST NOW I SUPPOSE MY DEAR HE SUGGESTED DOUBTFULLY
5703-47198-0029 THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN OVER WITH HER LADY BYRNE DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO SHE HAD ENGAGEMENTS SHE SAID FOR EVERY DAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BREAK
5703-47198-0030 HAD SIR ARTHUR FORGOTTEN THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE HAVING LARGE DINNER PARTIES ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITHOUT JULIET TO HELP HER IN PREPARING FOR THEM SHE DID NOT KNOW
5703-47198-0031 BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0032 SHE CAN GO ON MONDAY SEE THE LAWYERS ON TUESDAY AND COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY SAID LADY BYRNE THE HELPLESSNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS IS THE ONE THING I DISAPPROVE OF IN YOUR EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
5703-47198-0033 SUPPOSING SHE IS DETAINED IN LONDON HE SAID WHAT SHOULD DETAIN HER DEMANDED HIS WIFE UNLESS IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF HER PARENTS AND IF SHE FINDS THEM I PRESUME THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY CASE
5703-47198-0034 SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035 A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0036 ON MONDAY MORNING SHE LEFT OSTEND IN THE COMPANY OF HER MAID IT WAS A GLORIOUS AUGUST DAY ON SHORE THE HEAT WAS INTENSE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE STIFLING CARRIAGES OF THE CROWDED BOAT TRAIN
5703-47198-0037 AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038 SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0039 WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
5703-47198-0040 HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HER I HAVE BEEN ABROAD DURING A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REPLIED THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED A STERN LOOKING SCOTCHWOMAN WHO DID NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
5703-47198-0041 FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
5703-47198-0042 THERE MAY EVEN BE A SCOTCHMAN AMONG THE PORTERS YOU KNOW BY SOME CHANCE NO FEAR SAID HER NEIGHBOUR GLOOMILY THEY'LL BE LOCAL MEN I HAVE NAE DOUBT
5703-47198-0043 WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0044 IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH CROSSING IN SPITE OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY AND BROILING SUNSHINE AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN LAID LOW BY THE ROLLING OF THE VESSEL THEY DISPLAYED ANXIETY ENOUGH TO REACH LAND
5703-47198-0045 NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
5703-47198-0046 PUT HER INTO A CARRIAGE AND MINISTERED TO HER WANTS WITH THE HELP OF A TEA BASKET CONTAINING THE DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THEY WERE STEAMING HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LONDON SHE WAS TO LODGE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JERMYN STREET
5703-47198-0047 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0048 FOR SHE WAS ASLEEP THREE MINUTES AFTER HER HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW NOR DID SHE WAKE TILL HER MAID ROUSED HER THE NEXT MORNING
5703-47198-0049 OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0050 AND THE HEAT IN THE LOW CEILINGED ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR WHICH JULIET OCCUPIED FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY WAS OPPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SASH WINDOWS BEING OPENED TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY
5703-47198-0051 BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
5703-47198-0052 SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0054 ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
5703-47198-0055 AND SHE FILLED THE AIR WITH CASTLES OF EVERY STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THAT HER FANCY SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE FROM DOUBT OR MISGIVING SHE DRESSED QUICKLY IN THE GAYEST HUMOUR BUT WITH EVEN MORE CARE THAN SHE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON HER APPEARANCE
5703-47198-0056 SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0057 AND INQUIRING THEIR WAY TO BOND STREET FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE SHOP WINDOWS TO THEIR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY HAD IT ALMOST TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT IN THAT PART OF LONDON
5703-47198-0058 BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
5703-47198-0059 BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
