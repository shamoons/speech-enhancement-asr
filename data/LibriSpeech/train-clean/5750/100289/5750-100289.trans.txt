5750-100289-0000 THE CONTRARY IS TRUE WHAT WE NEED IS NOT LESS EDUCATION BUT MORE MORE TRAINED LEADERS TO UPHOLD THE STANDARDS OF CIVILIZATION BEFORE BOTH RACES AMONG INDIAN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY GRADUATES A FAILURE IS VERY RARE
5750-100289-0001 I AM SURE I HAVE NOT MET ONE AND REALLY DO NOT KNOW OF ONE THE PRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY POPULAR ERRORS WHENEVER AN INDIAN INDULGES IN ANY NOTORIOUS MISBEHAVIOR HE IS WIDELY HERALDED AS A CARLISLE GRADUATE
5750-100289-0002 ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ATHLETIC PROWESS OF ITS STUDENTS THEY HAVE MET AND DEFEATED THE ATHLETES OF MANY A WHITE UNIVERSITY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
5750-100289-0003 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE
5750-100289-0004 IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT THE COLLEGE EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN OF MY RACE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A FEAT CONSIDERING THEIR ANTECEDENTS AND WHOLLY FOREIGN POINT OF VIEW THEY HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO A NEW WAY OF THINKING
5750-100289-0005 FURTHERMORE THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEANS NEVERTHELESS AN INCREASING NUMBER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE UNDERTAKING TRIALS OF THE EDUCATED INDIAN
5750-100289-0006 I WISH TO CONTRADICT THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION THAT AN EDUCATED INDIAN WILL NECESSARILY MEET WITH STRONG PREJUDICE AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE OR WILL BE EDUCATED OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
5750-100289-0007 A PARTICULARLY ABLE OR WELL EQUIPPED MAN OF THEIR RACE IS A PUBLIC BLESSING AND ALL BUT PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT WAS THE OLD RULE AMONG US UP TO A VERY RECENT PERIOD AN EDUCATED INDIAN COULD NOT SUCCEED MATERIALLY
5750-100289-0008 HE COULD NOT BETTER HIMSELF BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUIRED HIM TO GIVE UNLIMITED FREE SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE OLD REGIME I HAVE EVEN KNOWN ONE TO BE KILLED BY THE CONTINUAL DEMANDS UPON HIM THERE WAS A TIME NOT SO LONG AGO EITHER
5750-100289-0009 WHEN THE EDUCATED INDIAN STOOD IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND SHADY POLITICIANS EVERY COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO EXPOSE AND REDRESS EVERY WRONG
5750-100289-0010 AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE SUCH EFFORTS ARE GENERALLY USELESS AND RESULTED ONLY IN DAMAGE TO HIS FINANCIAL POSITION AND HIS REPUTATION NO DOUBT HE OFTEN INVITED ATTACKS UPON HIMSELF BY A RASHNESS BORN OF HIS ARDENT SYMPATHY
5750-100289-0011 FOR HIS FELLOW TRIBESMEN IN THIS MATTER I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS LONG OBSERVATION EVEN IN THE OLD WILD DAYS AN EDUCATION WAS APPRECIATED BY THE INDIANS
5750-100289-0012 BUT IT WAS A HARD LIFE FOR THE EDUCATED MAN THEY MADE HIM CARRY TOO HEAVY A BURDEN WITHOUT MUCH RECOMPENSE SAVE HONOR AND RESPECT BUT WE HAVE PRETTY WELL PASSED THROUGH THAT PERIOD AND THE NATIVE GRADUATES OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS
5750-100289-0013 HAVE BEGUN TO SHOW THEIR STRENGTH AND ENLARGE THEIR VIEWS THEY HAVE NOT ONLY DONE WELL FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR RACE BUT THEY STAND BEFORE THE WORLD AS LIVING ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS CAPACITY DISPROVING MANY THEORIES CONCERNING UNTUTORED RACES
5750-100289-0014 NO INFERIOR RACE IT WAS DECLARED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION BY THE UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS AT LONDON IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THAT THERE IS NO INHERENTLY SUPERIOR RACE
5750-100289-0015 THEREFORE NO INFERIOR RACE FROM EVERY RACE SOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE MASTERED THE SAME CURRICULUM AND PASSED THE SAME TESTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES MEMBERS OF SO CALLED UNCIVILIZED RACES
5750-100289-0016 BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RACE IS TRANSFORMED CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION
5750-100289-0017 THE VERY MENTION OF THE NAME INDIAN IN EARLIER DAYS WOULD MAKE THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN'S BLOOD CREEP WITH THOUGHTS OF THE WAR WHOOP AND THE SCALPING KNIFE
5750-100289-0018 A LITTLE LATER IT SUGGESTED CHIEFLY FEATHERS AND PAINT AND BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST TO DAY THE ASSOCIATION IS RATHER WITH THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND ITS FAMOUS ATHLETES
5750-100289-0019 IT IS A FACT THAT THE INTELLIGENT AND EDUCATED INDIAN HAS NO SOCIAL PREJUDICE TO CONTEND WITH HIS COLOR IS NOT COUNTED AGAINST HIM HE IS RECEIVED CORDIALLY AND UPON EQUAL TERMS IN SCHOOL COLLEGE AND SOCIETY
5750-100289-0020 DOCTOR BOOKER WASHINGTON IS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING JOCOSELY THAT THE NEGRO BLOOD IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD FOR ONE DROP OF IT MAKES A NIGGER OF A WHITE MAN I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE INDIAN BLOOD IS EVEN STRONGER
5750-100289-0021 FOR A HALF BLOOD NEGRO AND INDIAN MAY PASS FOR AN INDIAN AND SO BE ADMITTED TO FIRST CLASS HOTELS AND EVEN TO HIGH SOCIETY
5750-100289-0022 IS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND HOLD UP HIS HEAD AS A MEMBER OF THE OLDEST AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY MANY OF OUR LEADING MEN HAVE MARRIED INTO EXCELLENT FAMILIES AND ARE PROMINENT IN CULTIVATED WHITE COMMUNITIES
5750-100289-0023 WE WANT THE BEST IN TWO RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF US HAVE ENTERED UPON EVERY KNOWN PROFESSIONAL CAREER SUCH AS MEDICINE LAW THE MINISTRY EDUCATION AND THE SCIENCES
5750-100289-0024 POLITICS AND HIGHER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ART AND LITERATURE IT MAY BE WELL TO MENTION SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN
5750-100289-0025 AT FIRST TO BE SURE AS INDIAN HERB DOCTORS OR QUACKS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER BUT LATER AS COMPETENT GRADUATED PHYSICIANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS UTILIZED SEVERAL IN THE INDIAN SERVICE AND OTHERS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN PRIVATE PRACTICE
5750-100289-0026 SOME NOTED INDIANS OF TO DAY PERHAPS THE FOREMOST OF THESE IS DOCTOR CARLOS MONTEZUMA OF CHICAGO A FULL BLOODED APACHE
5750-100289-0027 WHO WERE ENEMIES OF HIS PEOPLE HE WAS BROUGHT TO CHICAGO BY THE MAN WHO RANSOMED HIM A REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHEN HIS BENEFACTOR DIED THE BOY BECAME THE PROTEGE OF THE CHICAGO PRESS CLUB
5750-100289-0028 AND FROM THERE TO THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WHERE HE WAS GRADUATED FROM THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT ALL THIS TIME ALTHOUGH RECEIVING SOME AID FROM VARIOUS SOURCES HE LARGELY SUPPORTED HIMSELF
5750-100289-0029 AFTER GRADUATION DOCTOR MONTEZUMA WAS SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AS PHYSICIAN TO AN INDIAN AGENCY IN MONTANA AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE CARLISLE SCHOOL IN A FEW YEARS HE RETURNED TO CHICAGO AND OPENED AN OFFICE
5750-100289-0030 HE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT PHYSICIAN THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WAS RECENTLY MARRIED TO A LADY OF GERMAN DESCENT HE STANDS UNCOMPROMISINGLY FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0031 HOLDING THAT THE RED MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN SALVATION ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRACTITIONERS OF OUR RACE WAS DOCTOR SUSAN LA FLESCHE PICOTTE OF THE OMAHA TRIBE
5750-100289-0032 SHE HAS SINCE TAKEN UP PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ALSO HAD CHARGE OF A MISSION HOSPITAL DOCTOR PICOTTE IS A SISTER OF BRIGHT EYES SUSETTE LA FLESCHE AND ALSO OF FRANCIS LA FLESCHE OF WASHINGTON D C
5750-100289-0033 THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE

5750-100289-0035 SENATOR OWEN OF OKLAHOMA IS PART CHEROKEE THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS COME TO REALIZE HIS ABILITY AND INFLUENCE REPRESENTATIVE CARTER OF OKLAHOMA IS ALSO AN INDIAN
5750-100289-0036 DURING MY STUDENT DAYS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I WAS OFTEN TOLD THAT DANIEL WEBSTER WAS PART INDIAN ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE CERTAINLY HIS PHYSIOGNOMY AS WELL AS HIS UNEQUALLED LOGIC CORROBORATED THE STORY
5750-100289-0037 WE ALL KNOW THAT GOVERNORS AND OTHER MEN OF MARK HAVE PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES DESCENDANTS OF POCAHONTAS I HAVE MET SEVERAL IN THE WEST AND SOUTH
5750-100289-0038 BUT HAVE NEVER VERIFIED IT THEIR WONDERFUL AGGRESSIVENESS AND DAUNTLESS PUBLIC SERVICE IN MY MIND POINT TO NATIVE DESCENT AND IF THEY CAN TRUTHFULLY CLAIM IT
5750-100289-0039 AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX DOCTOR WASHINGTON MATHEWS A SURGEON IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY
5750-100289-0040 AND LEFT HIM WITH THE MISSIONARY TEACHER DOCTOR ALFRED L RIGGS TO REAR AND EDUCATE THIS MILITARY SURGEON AND SCIENTIST NOT ONLY ATTAINED THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL BUT HE BECAME ONE OF OUR FOREMOST ARCHAEOLOGISTS
5750-100289-0041 I WILL NOT PRETEND TO CLAIM FOR THE INDIAN ALL THE CREDIT OF THEIR TALENTS AND ENERGY IN THE MINISTRY WE HAVE MANY ABLE AND DEVOTED MEN MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION
5750-100289-0042 IS WELL KNOWN AS AN EVANGELISTIC PREACHER AND SINGER

5750-100289-0047 GRADUATED FROM YALE AND OBERLIN
5750-100289-0048 HAS DONE GOOD WORK AS FIELD SECRETARY AMONG THE INDIANS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I SHOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE MANY MINISTERS OF MY RACE WHO HAVE NO COLLEGE DEGREE NOR MUCH EDUCATION IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE YET WHO ARE AMONG OUR MOST ABLE AND INFLUENTIAL LEADERS
5750-100289-0049 WHO PASSED BUT A SHORT TIME IN SCHOOL HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PREACHER AMONG THE SIOUX BUT FOR MANY YEARS THEIR TRUSTED ADVISER AND REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK AFTER THEIR INTERESTS AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
5750-100289-0050 MOST OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES INDIAN SERVICE IT IS THE EXPRESS POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO USE THE EDUCATED INDIANS WHENEVER POSSIBLE IN PROMOTING THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR RACE INDEED SOME OF THE TREATIES INCLUDE THIS STIPULATION
5750-100289-0051 AND ALTHOUGH THEY MUST PASS A CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION TO PROVE THEIR FITNESS SUCH EXAMINATION IN THEIR CASE IS NON COMPETITIVE THEY HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN THE LARGER GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IN MANY INSTANCES WITH THE ADDITION OF NORMAL AND COLLEGE COURSES
5750-100289-0052 AT LEAST TWO ARE SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS A NUMBER OF YOUNG WOMEN CARLISLE GRADUATES HAVE TAKEN UP TRAINED NURSING AS A PROFESSION AND ARE PRACTISING SUCCESSFULLY BOTH AMONG WHITES AND INDIANS

5750-100289-0063 IN THE ATHLETIC WORLD THIS LITTLE RACE HAS NO PEER AS IS SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN BY THEIR REMARKABLE RECORD IN FOOTBALL BASEBALL AND TRACK ATHLETICS
5750-100289-0064 WHY HE DID NOT INTRODUCE FOOTBALL IN HIS SCHOOL WHY SAID HE IF I DID THAT HALF THE PRESS OF THE COUNTRY WOULD ATTACK ME FOR DEVELOPING THE ORIGINAL WAR INSTINCTS AND SAVAGERY OF THE INDIAN THE PUBLIC WOULD BE AFRAID TO COME TO OUR GAMES
5750-100289-0065 AT LEAST NOT IN PUBLIC NOT LONG AFTERWARD THE GAME WAS INTRODUCED AT CARLISLE AND I WAS ASKED BY THE GENERAL TO VISIT MONTANA AND THE DAKOTAS TO SECURE PUPILS FOR THE SCHOOL AND INCIDENTALLY RECRUITS FOR HIS FOOTBALL WARRIORS
5750-100289-0066 THE INDIANS VICTORY WAS COMPLETE THESE BOYS ALWAYS FIGHT THE BATTLE ON ITS OWN MERITS THEY PLAY A CLEAN GAME AND LOSE VERY FEW GAMES DURING THE SEASON ALTHOUGH THEY MEET ALL OUR LEADING UNIVERSITIES EACH ON ITS OWN HOME GROUNDS
5750-100289-0067 FROM THE FLEET DEERFOOT TO THIS DAY WE BOAST THE NOTED NAMES OF LONGBOAT SOCKALEXIS BEMUS PIERCE FRANK HUDSON TEWANIMA METOXEN MYERS BENDER AND JIM THORPE
5750-100289-0068 THORPE IS A GRADUATE OF THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN SWEDEN IN NINETEEN TWELVE HE WON THE TITLE OF THE GREATEST ALL ROUND ATHLETE IN THE WORLD PROBLEMS OF RACE LEADERSHIP
5750-100289-0069 AND WITH OLD TRIBAL JEALOUSIES AND ANTAGONISMS YET TO BE OVERCOME ANOTHER AND A MORE SERIOUS OBSTACLE IS THE DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE INDIAN AND THE ALMOST ARBITRARY POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0070 ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF PROGRESSIVE INDIANS WAS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH
5750-100289-0071 MY BROTHER JOHN EASTMAN AND MYSELF AT THAT TIME WE CONCLUDED THAT THE MOVEMENT WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD EITHER BY OUR OWN RACE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THAT THERE WAS GRAVE DANGER OF AROUSING THE ANTAGONISM OF THE BUREAU
5750-100289-0072 IF SUCH A SOCIETY WERE FORMED IT WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE RACE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE OFFICIALS AT WASHINGTON AND IN THE FIELD ARE SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM
5750-100289-0073 NOR ARE THEY ACCUSTOMED TO ALLOWING THE INDIAN A VOICE IN HIS OWN AFFAIRS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE RED MEN ARE ENLISTED IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE WHICH WOULD MAKE THEIR POSITION A VERY DIFFICULT ONE IN CASE OF ANY FRICTION WITH THE AUTHORITIES
5750-100289-0074 VERY FEW INDIANS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF THE BUREAU TO SPEAK AND ACT WITH ABSOLUTE FREEDOM SOME TEN YEARS LATER I WAS CALLED TO COLUMBUS OHIO TO LECTURE FOR THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
5750-100289-0075 ON THE SAME COURSE WITH DOCTOR COOLIDGE AND DOCTOR MONTEZUMA PROFESSOR F A MC KENZIE OF THE UNIVERSITY ARRANGED THE COURSE AND SOON AFTERWARD HE WROTE ME THAT HE BELIEVED THE TIME WAS NOW RIPE TO ORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY

5750-100289-0077 AND MISS LAURA CORNELIUS WE ORGANIZED AS A COMMITTEE AND ISSUED A GENERAL CALL FOR A CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER AT THE UNIVERSITY UPON THE CORDIAL INVITATION OF DOCTOR MC KENZIE AND PRESIDENT THOMPSON
5750-100289-0078 FOUR ANNUAL CONFERENCES HAVE NOW BEEN HELD AND THE FIFTH IS ANNOUNCED FOR NEXT OCTOBER AT OKLAHOMA CITY THE SOCIETY HAS FIVE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ASSOCIATE MEMBERS
5750-100289-0079 THE LATTER ARE WHITE FRIENDS OF THE RACE WHO ARE IN SYMPATHY WITH OUR OBJECTS
5750-100289-0080 AND ARTHUR C PARKER IS SECRETARY AND TREASURER THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS ISSUES A QUARTERLY JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCES AND THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIAN RACE
5750-100289-0081 AND THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL OUR PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED TO WORK TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION WHAT PRINCIPLES WE SHOULD STAND FOR AND WHAT LINE OF WORK WE OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE
5750-100289-0082 SHOULD WE DEVOTE OURSELVES LARGELY TO EXPOSING THE NUMEROUS FRAUDS COMMITTED UPON INDIANS OR SHOULD WE KEEP CLEAR OF THESE MATTERS AVOID DISCUSSION OF OFFICIAL METHODS AND ACTION
5750-100289-0083 AND SIMPLY AIM AT AROUSING RACIAL PRIDE AND AMBITION ALONG NEW LINES HOLDING UP A MODERN IDEAL FOR THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR YOUTH SHOULD WE PETITION CONGRESS AND IN GENERAL CONTINUE ALONG THE LINES OF THE OLDER INDIAN ASSOCIATIONS
5750-100289-0084 OR SHOULD WE RATHER DO INTENSIVE WORK AMONG OUR PEOPLE LOOKING ESPECIALLY TOWARD THEIR MORAL AND SOCIAL WELFARE I STAND FOR THE LATTER PLAN OTHERS THINK DIFFERENTLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT A WASHINGTON OFFICE HAS BEEN OPENED
5750-100289-0085 OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS FIRST TO PROMOTE AND COOPERATE WITH ALL EFFORTS LOOKING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDIAN IN ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH LEAVE HIM FREE AS A MAN
5750-100289-0086 TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL LAWS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION SECOND TO PROVIDE THROUGH OUR OPEN CONFERENCES THE MEANS FOR A FREE DISCUSSION ON ALL SUBJECTS BEARING ON THE WELFARE OF THE RACE THIRD
5750-100289-0087 TO PRESENT IN A JUST LIGHT THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE RACE TO PRESERVE ITS RECORDS AND EMULATE ITS DISTINGUISHING VIRTUES FOURTH TO PROMOTE CITIZENSHIP AND TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS THEREOF FIFTH
5750-100289-0088 SEVENTH TO DIRECT ITS ENERGIES EXCLUSIVELY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND UNIVERSAL INTERESTS AND NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO BE USED FOR ANY PERSONAL OR PRIVATE INTEREST
