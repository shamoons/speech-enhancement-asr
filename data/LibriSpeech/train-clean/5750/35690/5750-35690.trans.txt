5750-35690-0000 AFTER A LONG AND TEDIOUS DISCOURSE OF THESE SIX NON NATURAL THINGS AND THEIR SEVERAL RECTIFICATIONS
5750-35690-0001 OR THAT KIND OF PHYSIC WHICH CURETH BY MEDICINES WHICH APOTHECARIES MOST PART MAKE MINGLE OR SELL IN THEIR SHOPS MANY CAVIL AT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC AND HOLD IT UNNECESSARY UNPROFITABLE TO THIS OR ANY OTHER DISEASE
5750-35690-0002 BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH USE IT LEAST LIVE LONGEST
5750-35690-0003 RELATES OF THE ISLES OF ORCADES THE PEOPLE ARE STILL SOUND OF BODY AND MIND WITHOUT ANY USE OF PHYSIC
5750-35690-0004 DAMIANUS A GOES SAXO GRAMMATICUS AUBANUS BOHEMUS SAY THE LIKE OF THEM THAT LIVE IN NORWAY LAPLAND FINMARK BIARMIA CORELIA ALL OVER SCANDIA AND THOSE NORTHERN COUNTRIES THEY ARE MOST HEALTHFUL
5750-35690-0005 AND VERY LONG LIVED IN WHICH PLACES THERE IS NO USE AT ALL OF PHYSIC THE NAME OF IT IS NOT ONCE HEARD DITHMARUS BLESKENIUS IN HIS ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ICELAND SIXTEEN O SEVEN
5750-35690-0006 MOST PART THEY DRINK WATER AND WHEY
5750-35690-0007 I FIND THE SAME RELATION BY LERIUS AND SOME OTHER WRITERS OF INDIANS IN AMERICA PAULUS JOVIUS IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF BRITAIN AND LEVINUS LEMNIUS OBSERVE AS MUCH OF THIS OUR ISLAND
5750-35690-0008 AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
5750-35690-0009 MANY THAT DID ILL UNDER PHYSICIANS HANDS HAVE HAPPILY ESCAPED
5750-35690-0010 LEFT TO GOD AND NATURE AND THEMSELVES
5750-35690-0011 JURIDICIS MEDICIS FISCO FAS VIVERE RAPTO TIS A CORRUPT TRADE NO SCIENCE ART NO PROFESSION THE BEGINNING PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF IT ALL IS NAUGHT FULL OF IMPOSTURE UNCERTAINTY AND DOTH GENERALLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD
5750-35690-0012 THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF IT
5750-35690-0013 AND WHAT WAS APOLLO BUT THE DEVIL THE GREEKS FIRST MADE AN ART OF IT AND THEY WERE ALL DELUDED BY APOLLO'S SONS PRIESTS ORACLES IF WE MAY BELIEVE VARRO PLINY COLUMELLA MOST OF THEIR BEST MEDICINES WERE DERIVED FROM HIS ORACLES
5750-35690-0014 AESCULAPIUS HIS SON HAD HIS TEMPLES ERECTED TO HIS DEITY AND DID MANY FAMOUS CURES BUT AS LACTANTIUS HOLDS HE WAS A MAGICIAN A MERE IMPOSTOR
5750-35690-0015 PERFORMED MOST OF THEIR CURES THE FIRST THAT EVER WROTE IN PHYSIC TO ANY PURPOSE WAS HIPPOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLE AND COMMENTATOR GALEN WHOM SCALIGER CALLS FIMBRIAM HIPPOCRATIS
5750-35690-0016 THEIR PRECEPTS CONFUSED THEIR MEDICINES OBSOLETE AND NOW MOST PART REJECTED THOSE CURES WHICH THEY DID PARACELSUS HOLDS
5750-35690-0017 THEY THEMSELVES IDIOTS AND INFANTS AS ARE ALL THEIR ACADEMICAL FOLLOWERS THE ARABIANS RECEIVED IT FROM THE GREEKS AND SO THE LATINS ADDING NEW PRECEPTS AND MEDICINES OF THEIR OWN BUT SO IMPERFECT STILL THAT THROUGH IGNORANCE OF PROFESSORS IMPOSTORS MOUNTEBANKS EMPIRICS
5750-35690-0018 DISAGREEING OF SECTARIES WHICH ARE AS MANY ALMOST AS THERE BE DISEASES ENVY COVETOUSNESS AND THE LIKE THEY DO MUCH HARM AMONGST US
5750-35690-0019 AS HE SAID OF ADRIAN MULTITUDO MEDICORUM PRINCIPEM INTERFECIT A MULTITUDE OF PHYSICIANS HATH KILLED THE EMPEROR PLUS A MEDICO QUAM A MORBO PERICULI MORE DANGER THERE IS FROM THE PHYSICIAN THAN FROM THE DISEASE
5750-35690-0020 DOTH APPROPRIATE IT TO HERSELF AND TELLS A STORY OF ONE CURTIUS A PHYSICIAN IN VENICE BECAUSE HE WAS A STRANGER AND PRACTISED AMONGST THEM THE REST OF THE PHYSICIANS DID STILL CROSS HIM IN ALL HIS PRECEPTS IF HE PRESCRIBED HOT MEDICINES THEY WOULD PRESCRIBE COLD
5750-35690-0021 MISCENTES PRO CALIDIS FRIGIDA PRO FRIGIDIS HUMIDA PRO PURGANTIBUS ASTRINGENTIA BINDERS FOR PURGATIVES OMNIA PERTURBABANT IF THE PARTY MISCARRIED CURTIUM DAMNABANT CURTIUS KILLED HIM THAT DISAGREED FROM THEM
5750-35690-0022 SOMETIMES STUMBLES THEM ALL THEY CANNOT SO MUCH AS EASE THEY KNOW NOT HOW TO JUDGE OF IT IF BY PULSES THAT DOCTRINE SOME HOLD IS WHOLLY SUPERSTITIOUS
5750-35690-0023 IS NEITHER OBSERVED NOR UNDERSTOOD OF ANY AND FOR URINE THAT IS MERETRIX MEDICORUM THE MOST DECEITFUL THING OF ALL AS FORESTUS AND SOME OTHER PHYSICIANS HAVE PROVED AT LARGE
5750-35690-0024 I HAD RATHER BELIEVE AND COMMIT MYSELF TO A MERE EMPIRIC THAN TO A MERE DOCTOR AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY COMMEND THAT CUSTOM OF THE BABYLONIANS THAT HAVE NO PROFESSED PHYSICIANS BUT BRING ALL THEIR PATIENTS TO THE MARKET TO BE CURED
5750-35690-0025 WHICH HERODOTUS RELATES OF THE EGYPTIANS STRABO SARDUS AND AUBANUS BOHEMUS OF MANY OTHER NATIONS AND THOSE THAT PRESCRIBED PHYSIC
5750-35690-0026 A SECOND THE TEETH A THIRD THE HEAD
5750-35690-0027 I ACKNOWLEDGE IT A MOST NOBLE AND DIVINE SCIENCE
5750-35690-0028 AND THOSE OTHER GODS WERE CONFINED AND ADORED ALONE IN SOME PECULIAR PLACES AESCULAPIUS AND HIS TEMPLE AND ALTARS EVERYWHERE
5750-35690-0029 WITH ALL VIRTUOUS AND WISE MEN THEREFORE I HONOUR THE NAME AND CALLING AS I AM ENJOINED TO HONOUR THE PHYSICIAN FOR NECESSITY'S SAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN LIFTETH UP HIS HEAD AND IN THE SIGHT OF GREAT MEN HE SHALL BE ADMIRED
5750-35690-0030 BUT OF THIS NOBLE SUBJECT HOW MANY PANEGYRICS ARE WORTHILY WRITTEN
5750-35690-0031 I HAVE SAID YET ONE THING I WILL ADD THAT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC IS VERY MODERATELY AND ADVISEDLY TO BE USED
5750-35690-0032 IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF SUCH PURGES AS ARE UNSEASONABLY OR IMMODERATELY TAKEN THEY HAVE THEIR EXCELLENT USE IN THIS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER INFIRMITIES OF ALTERATIVES AND CORDIALS NO MAN DOUBTS BE THEY SIMPLES OR COMPOUNDS
