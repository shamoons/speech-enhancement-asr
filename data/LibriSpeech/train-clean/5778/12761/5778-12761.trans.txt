5778-12761-0000 CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001 ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0002 WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
5778-12761-0003 FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
5778-12761-0004 WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0005 BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
5778-12761-0006 WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0007 ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0008 CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
5778-12761-0009 WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010 THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
5778-12761-0011 ON THE SHORE OF THE BAY EIGHTY MILES DISTANT AXES AND MAULS WERE NECESSARY TODAY TO MAKE A ROAD THROUGH THE SNOW GOING AHEAD WITH CARSON TO RECONNOITRE THE ROAD WE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON THE RIVER WHICH MADE THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE
5778-12761-0012 CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
5778-12761-0013 IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
5778-12761-0014 BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
5778-12761-0015 THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
5778-12761-0016 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
5778-12761-0017 AND OCCASIONALLY WE PASSED A HILL SCATTERINGLY COVERED WITH IT THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST CONTINUED THE SAME AND AMONG THE TREES THE PINE WITH SHARP LEAVES AND VERY LARGE CONES WAS ABUNDANT SOME OF THEM BEING NOBLE TREES
5778-12761-0018 WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
5778-12761-0019 TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE OAK TREES APPEARED ON THE RIDGE AND SOON BECAME VERY FREQUENT ON THESE I REMARKED UNUSUALLY GREAT QUANTITIES OF MISTLETOE THE OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS VERY STEEP AND CONTINUOUS
5778-12761-0020 UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
5778-12761-0021 CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
5778-12761-0022 THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES
5778-12761-0023 NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO
5778-12761-0024 I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
5778-12761-0025 AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
5778-12761-0026 NEAR NIGHT FALL WE DESCENDED INTO THE STEEP RAVINE OF A HANDSOME CREEK THIRTY FEET WIDE AND I WAS ENGAGED IN GETTING THE HORSES UP THE OPPOSITE HILL WHEN I HEARD A SHOUT FROM CARSON WHO HAD GONE AHEAD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
5778-12761-0027 LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
5778-12761-0028 WE DROVE ALONG OUR HORSES AND ENCAMPED AT THE PLACE ABOUT DARK AND THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO MAKE A PLACE FOR SHELTER ON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM THREE HORSES WERE LOST TODAY PROVEAU
5778-12761-0029 A FINE YOUNG HORSE FROM THE COLUMBIA BELONGING TO CHARLES TOWNS AND ANOTHER INDIAN HORSE WHICH CARRIED OUR COOKING UTENSILS THE TWO FORMER GAVE OUT AND THE LATTER STRAYED OFF INTO THE WOODS AS WE REACHED THE CAMP
5778-12761-0030 CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
5778-12761-0031 WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
5778-12761-0032 WHEN IT WAS A COLD MOUNTAIN TORRENT FOAMING AMONG THE ROCKS
5778-12761-0033 HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
5778-12761-0034 IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
5778-12761-0035 WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER
5778-12761-0036 AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
5778-12761-0037 WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
5778-12761-0038 AND WE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD PUSHED ON DOWN THE STREAM I DETERMINED TO KEEP OUT FROM THE RIVER ALONG WHICH IT WAS NEARLY IMPRACTICABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS UNTIL IT SHOULD FORM A VALLEY
5778-12761-0039 AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
5778-12761-0040 AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION
5778-12761-0041 IN A SHORT DISTANCE WE CROSSED A LITTLE RIVULET WHERE WERE TWO OLD HUTS AND NEAR BY WERE HEAPS OF ACORN HULLS THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT WAS VERY RICH COVERED WITH AN EXUBERANT SWARD OF GRASS
5778-12761-0042 AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
5778-12761-0043 BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
5778-12761-0044 WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF
5778-12761-0045 SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL
5778-12761-0046 AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK
5778-12761-0047 BOTH WERE VOLUNTEERS AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN WAS PROMISED A PAIR OF PISTOLS NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE WHICH WOULD FREE US ALL FROM MUCH ANXIETY
5778-12761-0048 AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
5778-12761-0049 SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
