5789-57158-0000 ON THAT SAME WEDNESDAY REGINALD MORTON HAD CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE HAD ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS AND HAD FOUND HER ALONE MISSUS MASTERS AT THE TIME HAD BEEN OUT
5789-57158-0001 PICKING UP INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE GREAT CASE AND THE TWO YOUNGER GIRLS HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL REGINALD AS HE WALKED HOME FROM BRAGTON ALL ALONE ON THAT OCCASION WHEN LARRY HAD RETURNED WITH MARY WAS QUITE SURE
5789-57158-0002 THAT HE WOULD NEVER WILLINGLY GO INTO MARY'S PRESENCE AGAIN WHY SHOULD HE DISTURB HIS MIND ABOUT SUCH A GIRL
5789-57158-0003 BUT ON THIS WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED A LETTER AND AS HE TOLD HIMSELF MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT LETTER HE CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE AND ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS
5789-57158-0004 SHE WANTS YOU TO GO TO HER AT CHELTENHAM FOR A MONTH OH MISTER MORTON WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO HOW SHOULD I NOT LIKE TO GO LADY USHANT IS MY DEAREST DEAREST FRIEND IT IS SO VERY GOOD OF HER TO THINK OF ME
5789-57158-0005 SHE TALKS OF THE FIRST WEEK IN DECEMBER AND WANTS YOU TO BE THERE FOR CHRISTMAS I DON'T AT ALL KNOW THAT I CAN GO MISTER MORTON WHY NOT GO I'M AFRAID MAMMA WILL NOT SPARE ME
5789-57158-0006 THERE WERE MANY REASONS SHE COULD HARDLY GO ON SUCH A VISIT WITHOUT SOME RENEWAL OF HER SCANTY WARDROBE WHICH PERHAPS THE FAMILY FUNDS WOULD NOT PERMIT
5789-57158-0007 AND AS SHE KNEW VERY WELL MISSUS MASTERS WAS NOT AT ALL FAVOURABLE TO LADY USHANT IF THE OLD LADY HAD ALTOGETHER KEPT MARY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY WELL BUT SHE HAD NOT DONE SO
5789-57158-0008 AND MISSUS MASTERS HAD MORE THAN ONCE SAID THAT THAT KIND OF THING MUST BE ALL OVER MEANING THAT MARY WAS TO DROP HER INTIMACY WITH HIGH BORN PEOPLE THAT WERE OF NO REAL USE AND THEN THERE WAS MISTER TWENTYMAN AND HIS SUIT
5789-57158-0009 THAT HER ONLY ESCAPE FROM HOME WOULD BE BY BECOMING MISSUS TWENTYMAN I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE MISTER MORTON MY AUNT WILL BE VERY SORRY OH HOW SORRY SHALL I BE
5789-57158-0010 IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN BEFORE ME THEN HE SAID WHAT HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID I THOUGHT MISS MASTERS THAT YOUR HEAVEN WAS ALL HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT MISTER MORTON
5789-57158-0011 SHE ASKED BLUSHING UP TO HER HAIR OF COURSE SHE KNEW WHAT HE MEANT AND OF COURSE SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM EVER SINCE THAT WALK HER MIND HAD BEEN TROUBLED BY IDEAS AS TO WHAT HE WOULD THINK ABOUT HER
5789-57158-0012 AND NOW HE WAS TELLING HER WHAT HE THOUGHT I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE HAPPY HERE WITHOUT GOING TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN WHO AFTER ALL
5789-57158-0013 I DON'T WANT ANY AMUSEMENT AT ANY RATE YOU WILL ANSWER LADY USHANT OF COURSE I SHALL ANSWER HER PERHAPS YOU CAN LET ME KNOW SHE WISHES ME TO TAKE YOU TO CHELTENHAM I SHALL GO FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT I SHALL NOT STAY LONGER
5789-57158-0014 IF YOU ARE GOING PERHAPS YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO TRAVEL WITH YOU OF COURSE IT WOULD BE VERY KIND BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I SHALL GO I AM SURE LADY USHANT WON'T BELIEVE THAT I AM KEPT AWAY FROM HER BY ANY PLEASURE OF MY OWN HERE
5789-57158-0015 I CAN EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AND SHE WILL UNDERSTAND ME SHE HARDLY MEANT TO REPROACH HIM SHE DID NOT MEAN TO ASSUME AN INTIMACY SUFFICIENT FOR REPROACH BUT HE FELT THAT SHE HAD REPROACHED HIM
5789-57158-0016 AT ANY RATE I WILL WRITE TO LADY USHANT AND WILL ASK PAPA TO LET YOU KNOW THEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM BUT TO GO AND YET HE WANTED TO SAY SOME OTHER WORD
5789-57158-0017 IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IN THE LEAST I ONLY WANT LADY USHANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF I COULD POSSIBLY GO TO HER I WOULD RATHER DO THAT THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
5789-57158-0018 BECAUSE LADY USHANT IS KIND TO ME I NEEDN'T EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SO REGINALD MORTON WAS OF COURSE THE OTHER PEOPLE THEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT I DID SO LONG HE SAID
5789-57158-0019 TO WALK ROUND THE OLD PLACE WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY BEFORE THESE PEOPLE CAME THERE AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WOULD NOT COME WITH ME I WAS COMING BUT YOU WENT BACK WITH THAT OTHER MAN
5789-57158-0020 OF COURSE I DID WHEN YOU SHOWED SO PLAINLY THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO JOIN YOU WHAT WAS I TO DO I COULDN'T SEND HIM AWAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF OURS AND VERY KIND TO DOLLY AND KATE
5789-57158-0021 I WISHED SO MUCH TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE OLD DAYS AND I WISH TO GO TO YOUR AUNT MISTER MORTON BUT WE CAN'T ALL OF US HAVE WHAT WE WISH OF COURSE I SAW THAT YOU WERE VERY ANGRY BUT I COULDN'T HELP THAT
5789-57158-0022 A MAN MAY WISH TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH A VERY OLD FRIEND WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED AND YET NOT BE GRAND I DARE SAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS JUST AS GOOD AS I AM
5789-57158-0023 I BELIEVE HIM TO BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER FOR HE EARNS HIS BREAD AND TAKES CARE OF HIS MOTHER AND AS FAR AS I KNOW DOES HIS DUTY THOROUGHLY I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE MISTER MORTON AND OF COURSE I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL IT
5789-57158-0024 HE HAD COME THERE ARDENTLY WISHING THAT SHE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO GO TO HIS AUNT AND RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HER HIMSELF IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NOW HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT GO
5789-57158-0025 IF SHE HAD MADE HER ELECTION SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO ABIDE BY IT IF SHE MEANT TO MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN WHAT GOOD COULD SHE GET BY ASSOCIATING WITH HIS AUNT OR WITH HIM
5789-57158-0026 HE WAS OF COURSE ALTOGETHER UNCONSCIOUS WHAT GRAND THINGS HIS COUSIN JOHN HAD INTENDED TO DO BY HIM HAD NOT THE HONOURABLE OLD LADY INTERFERED BUT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT DUTY REQUIRED HIM TO CALL AT THE HOUSE
5789-57158-0027 SO HE WALKED BY THE PATH ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND WHEN HE CAME OUT ON THE GRAVEL ROAD NEAR THE FRONT DOOR HE FOUND A GENTLEMAN SMOKING A CIGAR AND LOOKING AROUND HIM
5789-57158-0028 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH MUST BE NARRATED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER THE SENATOR LIFTED HIS HAT AND REMARKED THAT IT WAS A VERY FINE AFTERNOON REGINALD LIFTED HIS HAT AND ASSENTED
5789-57158-0029 MISTER MORTON SIR I THINK IS OUT WITH THE LADIES TAKING A DRIVE I WILL LEAVE A CARD THEN THE OLD LADY IS AT HOME SIR IF YOU WISH TO SEE HER CONTINUED THE SENATOR FOLLOWING REGINALD UP TO THE DOOR
5789-57158-0030 YOU LIVE IN THESE PARTS SIR ASKED THE SENATOR IN THE TOWN YONDER BECAUSE MISTER MORTON'S HOUSEKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW YOU SHE KNOWS ME VERY WELL AS I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
5789-57158-0031 GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHO LIVES IN THAT COUNTRY RESIDENCE WHAT YOU CALL A FARM HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD REGINALD SAID THAT HE PRESUMED THE GENTLEMAN WAS ALLUDING TO MISTER TWENTYMAN'S HOUSE

5789-57158-0033 AH YES HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY UNCLE BECAUSE REGINALD DIDN'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH AND HE KNEW HE OUGHT NOT TO SAY BROTHER BECAUSE THE ELDER BROTHER IN ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD THE PROPERTY I AM MISTER JOHN MORTON'S COUSIN
5789-57158-0034 I ASKED WHETHER YOU WERE THE OWNER OF THAT FARM HOUSE BECAUSE I INTRUDED JUST NOW BY PASSING THROUGH THE YARDS AND I WOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR THEN REGINALD HAVING THUS DONE HIS DUTY
5789-57158-0035 RETURNED HOME MARY MASTERS WHEN SHE WAS ALONE WAS AGAIN VERY ANGRY WITH HERSELF SHE KNEW THOROUGHLY HOW PERVERSE SHE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE DECLARED THAT LARRY TWENTYMAN WAS A FIT COMPANION FOR HERSELF
5789-57158-0036 AND THAT SHE HAD SAID IT ON PURPOSE TO PUNISH THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HER NOT A DAY PASSED OR HARDLY AN HOUR OF A DAY IN WHICH SHE DID NOT TELL HERSELF THAT THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED AND THE EARLY ASSOCIATIONS OF HER LIFE
