5789-57195-0000 PROVIDENCE INTERFERES THE BATTLE WAS CARRIED ON VERY FIERCELY IN MISTER MASTERS HOUSE IN DILLSBOROUGH TO THE MISERY OF ALL WITHIN IT
5789-57195-0001 THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN INTENSELY ANXIOUS FOR THE MARRIAGE WISHING TO HAVE LARRY FOR A BROTHER LOOKING FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THEIR SHARE IN THE UNRESTRICTED PLENTEOUSNESS OF CHOWTON FARM
5789-57195-0002 THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEIR ELDER SISTER WHILE THE ASSURANCE WAS STILL WITH THEM THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO FORGIVE THEM BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED BY BOTH OF THEM THAT POOR LAWRENCE HAD NO CHANCE
5789-57195-0003 THEY WERE SAD AND DOWNHEARTED IN ALL THAT MISERY THE POOR ATTORNEY HAD THE WORST OF IT MARY WAS FREE FROM HER STEPMOTHER'S ZEAL AND HER STEPMOTHER'S PERSECUTION AT ANY RATE AT NIGHT
5789-57195-0004 BUT THE POOR FATHER WAS HARDLY ALLOWED TO SLEEP FOR MISSUS MASTERS NEVER GAVE UP HER GAME AS ALTOGETHER LOST THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE DRIVEN ALTERNATELY INTO TOWERING PASSION AND PROSTRATE HYSTERICS
5789-57195-0005 SHE WOULD STILL COME AGAIN TO THE BATTLE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD SHE SAID BRING LARRY TWENTYMAN BACK TO HIS COURTSHIP AND THAT WORD MIGHT BE SPOKEN IF MARY'S VISIT TO CHELTENHAM WERE FORBIDDEN
5789-57195-0006 LET MARY ONCE BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A FINE LADY AND THEN SHE WOULD MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN QUICK ENOUGH BUT THIS USHANTING THIS JOURNEYING TO CHELTENHAM IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE DONE
5789-57195-0007 WAS THE VERY WAY TO PROMOTE THE DISEASE THIS MISSUS MASTERS SAID IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON NIGHT AND DAY TILL THE POOR HUSBAND LONGED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE
5789-57195-0008 IN ALL THESE DISPUTES HE NEVER QUITE YIELDED THOUGH HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM HE WAS STILL FIRM HE WOULD TURN HIS BACK TO HIS WIFE AND LET HER RUN ON WITH HER ARGUMENTS WITHOUT A WORD OF ANSWER
5789-57195-0009 BUT AT LAST THERE CAME TO HER A GLEAM OF HOPE MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT MARY SHOULD MAKE HER JOURNEY ON FRIDAY THE TWELFTH FEBRUARY AND THAT REGINALD MORTON WAS AGAIN TO ACCOMPANY HER
5789-57195-0010 WHICH WAS IN ITSELF OF ALL THINGS THE MOST PERNICIOUS IF MARY MUST GO TO CHELTENHAM WHY COULD SHE NOT GO BY HERSELF SECOND CLASS LIKE ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN
5789-57195-0011 NOBODY WOULD EAT HER MISSUS MASTERS DECLARED BUT REGINALD WAS FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF ACCOMPANYING HER HE HAD NO OBJECTION WHATEVER TO THE SECOND CLASS IF MISTER MASTERS PREFERRED IT
5789-57195-0012 THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0013 LADY USHANT WROTE TO POSTPONE THE VISIT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO BRAGTON HER LETTER TO MARY THOUGH AFFECTIONATE WAS VERY SHORT HER GRAND NEPHEW JOHN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
5789-57195-0014 HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND WITH THAT WISH SHE WAS BOUND TO COMPLY OF COURSE SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE MARY AT BRAGTON OR IF THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE SHE HERSELF WOULD COME INTO DILLSBOROUGH
5789-57195-0015 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE THE LENGTH OF HER VISIT BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE HOPED THAT MARY WOULD RETURN WITH HER TO CHELTENHAM THE OLD LADY'S LETTER TO REGINALD WAS MUCH LONGER BECAUSE IN THAT SHE HAD TO SPEAK OF THE STATE OF JOHN MORTON'S HEALTH
5789-57195-0016 AND OF HER SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TO HIS BEDSIDE OF COURSE SHE WOULD GO THOUGH SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH SATISFACTION TO A MEETING WITH THE HONBLE MISSUS MORTON
5789-57195-0017 THEN SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO JOHN MORTON REGINALD HIMSELF WOULD BE THE SQUIRE OF BRAGTON REGINALD WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS AT ONCE WENT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE
5789-57195-0018 BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN SEEING MARY HE LEARNED HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE ALL AWARE THAT THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO MISSUS MASTERS IT SEEMED THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN A DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE
5789-57195-0019 LADY USHANT'S LETTER HAD BEEN RECEIVED ON THE THURSDAY AND MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO COMMUNICATE WITH LARRY TWENTYMAN SHE WAS NOT EXCELLENT HERSELF AT THE WRITING OF LETTERS AND THEREFORE SHE GOT DOLLY TO BE THE SCRIBE
5789-57195-0020 WHEN THIS WAS RECEIVED THE POOR MAN WAS SMOKING HIS MOODY PIPE IN SILENCE AS HE ROAMED ABOUT HIS OWN FARMYARD IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
5789-57195-0021 HE HAD NOT AS YET KNOWN ANY COMFORT AND WAS STILL FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF SELLING THE FARM HE HAD BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE OR TWICE BUT FANCIED THAT PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PECULIAR EYES
5789-57195-0022 HE DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY FOUND OR NOT AND WHEN CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS HELD TO HAVE DISGRACED HIMSELF THOROUGHLY BY WASTING AN HOUR IN DIGGING OUT AND THEN KILLING A VIXEN HE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY ABOUT IT
5789-57195-0023 BUT AS HE READ DOLLY'S NOTE THERE CAME BACK SOMETHING OF LIFE INTO HIS EYES HE HAD FORSWORN THE CLUB BUT WOULD CERTAINLY GO WHEN THUS INVITED HE WROTE A SCRAWL TO DOLLY I'LL COME
5789-57195-0024 AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
5789-57195-0025 JOHN MORTON MIGHT DIE AND THEN WHO COULD TELL WHETHER LADY USHANT WOULD EVER RETURN TO CHELTENHAM IN THIS WAY THE SHORT LIVED PEACE SOON CAME TO AN END ESPECIALLY AS MISSUS MASTERS ENDEAVOURED TO UTILIZE FOR GENERAL FAMILY PURPOSES
5789-57195-0026 ON THE SATURDAY LARRY CAME TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF MISTER MASTERS WHO WAS STILL IN HIS OFFICE AT HALF PAST SEVEN MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND CONVEYED HIM AWAY INTO THE SACRED DRAWING ROOM
5789-57195-0027 MARY IS NOT GOING SHE SAID NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM IT HAS ALL BEEN PUT OFF SHE SHAN'T GO AT ALL IF I CAN HELP IT BUT WHY HAS IT BEEN PUT OFF MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0028 LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON I SUPPOSE THAT POOR MAN IS DYING HE IS VERY ILL CERTAINLY
5789-57195-0029 I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS SUCH FRIENDS WITH THE SQUIRE AS THAT WELL THERE IT IS LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON AND MARY IS NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM
5789-57195-0030 THIS SHE SAID AS THOUGH THE NEWS MUST BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO LARRY TWENTYMAN HE STOOD FOR AWHILE SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AS HE THOUGHT OF IT
5789-57195-0031 AT LAST IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT MARY'S CONTINUAL RESIDENCE IN DILLSBOROUGH WOULD OF ITSELF HARDLY ASSIST HIM I DON'T SEE MISSUS MASTERS THAT THAT WILL MAKE HER A BIT KINDER TO ME
5789-57195-0032 LARRY DON'T YOU BE A COWARD NOR YET SOFT AS FOR COWARD MISSUS MASTERS I DON'T KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU REALLY DO LOVE THE GIRL I DO I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT
5789-57195-0033 AND YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED YOUR MIND NOT A BIT THAT'S WHY I SPEAK OPEN TO YOU DON'T YOU BE AFRAID OF HER WHAT'S THE LETTER WHICH A GIRL LIKE THAT WRITES
5789-57195-0034 WHEN SHE GETS TANTRUMS INTO HER HEAD OF COURSE SHE'LL WRITE A LETTER BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE MISSUS MASTERS WHO SAYS SO I SAY THERE AIN'T NOBODY NOBODY
5789-57195-0035 IF ANYBODY TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONLY JUST TO PUT YOU OFF
5789-57195-0036 COME TO MORROW AND HAVE A GOSSIP WITH THE GIRLS TOGETHER AND SHOW THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLUCK UP THAT'S THE WAY TO WIN HER LARRY DID GO TO THE CLUB AND DID THINK VERY MUCH OF IT AS HE WALKED HOME
5789-57195-0037 HE HAD PROMISED TO COME ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IN THAT THEORY OF BOOKS AND POETRY PUT FORWARD BY MISSUS MASTERS
