587-41611-0000 ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS BELONGING TO JULIA'S PARTY WERE SILENT CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OMNIBUS HOUSE THE STORY LEAKED OUT CREATING CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UPPER CLASSES JULIA CROSBY HAD A SHREWD SUSPICION
587-41611-0001 THAT EDNA WRIGHT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL PURVEYOR OF THE NEWS AND IN THIS SHE WAS RIGHT EDNA HAD UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY TOLD IT TO A SOPHOMORE WHO IMMEDIATELY TOLD IT TO HER DEAREST FRIEND AND SO THE TALE TRAVELED UNTIL IT REACHED ELEANOR
587-41611-0002 WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
587-41611-0003 FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41611-0004 A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
587-41611-0005 THE SORORITY THAT ELEANOR HAD MENTIONED IN HER LETTER TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WAS NOW IN FULL FLOWER THE SEVEN GIRLS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE OMNIBUS HOUSE WERE THE CHOSEN MEMBERS THEY WORE PINS IN THE SHAPE OF SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
587-41611-0006 AND WENT ABOUT MAKING MYSTERIOUS SIGNS TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER THEY MET THE VERY NAME OF THE SOCIETY WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY THOUGH NORA O'MALLEY WAS HEARD TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A BRANCH OF THE BLACK HAND
587-41611-0007 ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
587-41611-0008 WHO WOULD FOLLOW HER ABOUT LIKE SHEEP AND IT WAS OVER THESE GIRLS THAT GRACE FELT WORRIED IF ELEANOR WERE TO ORGANIZE AND CARRY OUT ANY MALICIOUS PIECE OF MISCHIEF AND THEY WERE IMPLICATED THEY WOULD ALL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT SHE WOULD BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
587-41611-0009 GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
587-41611-0010 THEY SEEM POSSESSED WITH IMPS THE PHI SIGMA TAU GIRLS AND A FEW OF THE GRINDS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO BEHAVE LATELY IT'S LARGELY DUE TO ELEANOR I THINK REPLIED ANNE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME QUITE A POWER AMONG SOME OF THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS
587-41611-0011 HARDLY A RECITATION PASSES IN MY CLASS
587-41611-0012 THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
587-41611-0013 THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
587-41611-0014 I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR SOCIETY WILL LAST LONG AT ANY RATE THOSE GIRLS ARE SURE TO QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AND THAT WILL END THE WHOLE THING OR THEY MAY GO TOO FAR AND HAVE MISS THOMPSON TO RECKON WITH AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY COOL THEIR ARDOR O GIRLS EXCLAIMED GRACE
587-41611-0015 THERE IS TALK OF GIVING A SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY WITH MISS TEBBS TO ENGINEER IT AND THE CAST TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE THREE LOWER CLASSES THE SENIORS OF COURSE WILL GIVE THEIR OWN PLAY LATER HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ASKED ANNE MISS THOMPSON HERSELF TOLD ME ABOUT IT REPLIED GRACE
587-41611-0016 I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
587-41611-0017 THE PLAY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED UPON YET REPLIED GRACE BUT THE OBJECT OF IT IS TO GET SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THE PLAN IS TO CHARGE FIFTY CENTS A PIECE FOR THE TICKETS AND TO GIVE EACH GIRL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM TO SELL
587-41611-0018 HOWEVER I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER MUCH ABOUT THE PLAY NOW FOR THE SENIOR TEAM HAS JUST SENT ME A CHALLENGE TO PLAY THEM SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SO I'LL HAVE TO GET THE TEAM TOGETHER AND GO TO WORK WE'RE AWFULLY LATE THIS YEAR ABOUT STARTING DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED NORA
587-41611-0019 YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41611-0020 ANNE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MORE LOVE FOR THE STAGE THAN YOU WILL ADMIT SAID GRACE LAUGHING YOU ARE ALL TAKEN UP WITH THE IDEA OF THIS PLAY IF ONE COULD LIVE IN THE SAME ATMOSPHERE AS THAT OF HOME THEN THERE COULD BE NO PROFESSION MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF THE ACTOR REPLIED ANNE THOUGHTFULLY
587-41611-0021 IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
587-41611-0022 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SENSE OF POWER THAT ONE HAS OVER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS THAT MAKES ACTING SO FASCINATING IT IS THE OTHER SIDE THAT I HATE SHE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER I SUPPOSE THEATRICAL PEOPLE DO UNDERGO MANY HARDSHIPS SAID GRACE
587-41611-0023 WHO NOW THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN OPENED WANTED TO HEAR MORE OF ANNE'S VIEWS OF THE STAGE UNLESS ANY GIRL HAS REMARKABLE TALENT I SHOULD ADVISE HER TO KEEP OFF THE STAGE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY OF COURSE WHEN A GIRL COMES OF A THEATRICAL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS
587-41611-0024 LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
587-41611-0025 AND HOW TO AVOID THEM THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF HER BECOMING GREAT TOO OF COURSE REAL STARS DO APPEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ARE TOO TALENTED TO BE KEPT DOWN HOWEVER THE REALLY GREAT ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
587-41611-0026 WHEN I COMPARE MY LIFE BEFORE I CAME HERE WITH THE GOOD TIMES I HAVE HAD SINCE I MET YOU GIRLS I HATE THE VERY IDEA OF THE STAGE ONLY SHE CONCLUDED WITH A SHAME FACED AIR THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE DESIRE TO ACT IS IRRESISTIBLE
587-41611-0027 SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
587-41611-0028 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL BE THROUGH DINNER BY HALF PAST TWO YOU HAD BETTER BRING YOUR GIRLS TO MY HOUSE EACH OF YOU IS TO HAVE TWO AND JESSICA HAS ONE BESIDES MABEL I AM TO HAVE THREE I FOUND ANOTHER YESTERDAY DAVID PROMISED TO GET ME THE TICKETS
587-41611-0029 BY THE WAY GIRLS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OF ANY USE TO INVITE ELEANOR ELEANOR EXCLAIMED NORA AFTER WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR INVITATION INTO THE FIRE FOR IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL DO SO WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT
