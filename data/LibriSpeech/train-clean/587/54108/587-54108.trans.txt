587-54108-0000 SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
587-54108-0001 BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
587-54108-0002 THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
587-54108-0003 WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
587-54108-0004 YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
587-54108-0005 KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
587-54108-0006 THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
587-54108-0007 HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
587-54108-0008 RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
587-54108-0009 SHE ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THAT RUTH WHO WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET TASTED SCARCELY ANYTHING HER FATHER ALSO OBSERVED IT AND RESOLVED UPON A COURSE OF STRICT SURVEILLANCE HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE ON THE EARLY MORNING'S TRAIN
587-54108-0010 THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
587-54108-0011 AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
587-54108-0012 FATHER SAYS HE HAS AT LAST SCARED UP TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER AND PLAY A RUBBER OF WHIST MISTER LEVICE FELT HIMSELF A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE AND MISTER TYRRELL HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF OPPONENTS AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP THE SEARCH
587-54108-0013 NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
587-54108-0014 RUTH AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR IF SHE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF RUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS MIND BUT SINCE HIS WIFE WAS THERE WHAT HARM COULD ACCRUE THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT SO WITH A SINCERE APOLOGY HE WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL
587-54108-0015 HE HARDLY APPRECIATED WHAT AN ADMIRABLE AIDE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM IN HIS WIFE KEMP SAT UPON THE TOP STEP AND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE RAILING
587-54108-0016 WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
587-54108-0017 BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
587-54108-0018 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
587-54108-0019 THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
587-54108-0020 AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
587-54108-0021 A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
587-54108-0022 IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
587-54108-0023 HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
587-54108-0024 PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
587-54108-0025 SHE WOULD MEET AND ANSWER EVERY ONE OF HIS LONG GLANCES IN KIND SHE WOUND A BLACK LACE SHAWL AROUND HER HEAD AND WITH SOME WRAPS FOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT HADN'T YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR SHOULDERS HE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY AS SHE APPEARED
587-54108-0026 AND DISGUST THE NIGHT WITH LACK OF APPRECIATION SHE TURNED TO A CORNER OF THE PORCH AND LIFTED A PAIR OF OARS TO HER SHOULDER WHY HE SAID IN SURPRISE COMING TOWARD HER YOU KEEP YOUR OARS AT HOME ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
587-54108-0027 WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
587-54108-0028 HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
587-54108-0029 THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
587-54108-0030 OTHERS ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES ALSO HE REMARKED AS THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE PEBBLY BEACH A FAINT CRESCENT MOON SHONE OVER THE WATER RUTH WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE BOAT AGROUND ON THE SHORE IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKLE SHELL HE SAID
587-54108-0031 AS HE PUT ONE FOOT IN AFTER SHOVING IT OFF
587-54108-0032 IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
587-54108-0033 STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
587-54108-0034 YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
587-54108-0035 THAT IS NO HINDRANCE TO MY VOLUBILITY I AM GLAD TO SAY A BACK IS NOT VERY INSPIRING OR EXPRESSIVE BUT RUTH CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU LOOK BORED IF I WAX TOO DISCURSIVE IT WAS A TINY BOAT
587-54108-0036 AND SEATED THUS KEMP'S KNEES WERE NOT HALF A FOOT FROM RUTH'S WHITE GOWN WILL YOU DIRECT ME HE SAID AS HE SWEPT AROUND I HAVE NOT ROWED ON THIS RIVER FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU CAN KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE SHE SAID LEANING BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0037 SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
587-54108-0038 AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
587-54108-0039 SOME MERRY ROWERS DOWN THE RIVER WERE SINGING COLLEGE SONGS HARMONIOUSLY
587-54108-0040 THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
587-54108-0041 SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0042 HER HEAD WAS LEANING AGAINST THE FLAG STAFF
587-54108-0043 DOCTOR KEMP MOVED QUIETLY BACK TO HIS FORMER POSITION FAR ACROSS THE RIVER A WOMAN'S SILVERY VOICE WAS SINGING THE SWEET OLD LOVE SONG JUANITA OVERHEAD THE GOLDEN CRESCENT MOON HUNG LOW FROM THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN PULSATING WITH STARS
587-54108-0044 SHE SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE SO STILL SHE SAT HER SLENDER HANDS LOOSELY CLASPED IN HER LAP DOCTOR KEMP SAT OPPOSITE HER AND MISSUS LEVICE SLEPT SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY SPED THE TINY BOAT
587-54108-0045 LONG GENTLE STROKES TOUCHED THE WATER AND PRESENTLY THE OARS LAY IDLE IN THEIR LOCKS THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY DRIFTING THE WATER DIPPED AND LAPPED ABOUT THE SIDES THE TENDER WOMAN'S VOICE ACROSS THE WATER STOLE TO THEM
587-54108-0046 SINGING OF LOVE THEIR EYES MET
587-54108-0047 EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
587-54108-0048 TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
587-54108-0049 THEY HAD DRIFTED INTO A COVE AND SHE WAS COWERING FROM THE OVER HANGING BOUGHS I DO NOT CARE TO BE ABSALOMED WHERE WERE YOUR EYES RUTH SHE COMPLAINED AS KEMP PUSHED OUT WITH A HAPPY APOLOGETIC LAUGH
587-54108-0050 NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
587-54108-0051 WHEN HE TURNED FOR RUTH SHE HAD ALREADY SPRUNG ASHORE AND HAD STARTED UP THE SLOPE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OARS LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
587-54108-0052 AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
587-54108-0053 SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
587-54108-0054 THERE IS NOTHING ABROAD HERE BUT THE STARS SHE ANSWERED FLITTING BEFORE THEM AND THEY ARE STANCH SILENT FRIENDS ON SUCH A NIGHT REMARKED KEMP SOFTLY
587-54108-0055 AND STOOD INSIDE OF IT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE HOME TILL MONDAY HE SAID TAKING MISSUS LEVICE'S HAND AND RAISING HIS HAT AND I AM OFF ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN GOOD BY AS SHE TURNED IN AT THE GATE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO RUTH
587-54108-0056 HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
587-54108-0057 SLEEP WITH THIS NEW CROWN UPON HER HUMBLE AS THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR MAID MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THE KING RAISED HER SHE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD BEEN THUS CHOSEN BY ONE WHOM SHE HAD DEEMED SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HER
