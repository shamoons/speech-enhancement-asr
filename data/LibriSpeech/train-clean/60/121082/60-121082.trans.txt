60-121082-0000 THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
60-121082-0001 WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE HE OFFERED A SEAT IN HIS LANDAU TO MADAME DANGLARS THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER THE CARE OF HIS WIFE
60-121082-0002 AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
60-121082-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
60-121082-0004 WITHOUT OPPOSING THEIR ARRANGEMENTS HE ALLOWED MORREL CHATEAU RENAUD AND DEBRAY TO LEAVE ON HORSEBACK AND THE LADIES IN M DE VILLEFORT'S CARRIAGE DANGLARS MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0005 HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ANDREA CAVALCANTI FOUND HIS TILBURY WAITING AT THE DOOR THE GROOM IN EVERY RESPECT A CARICATURE OF THE ENGLISH FASHION
60-121082-0006 WAS STANDING ON TIPTOE TO HOLD A LARGE IRON GRAY HORSE ANDREA HAD SPOKEN VERY LITTLE DURING DINNER HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT LAD AND HE FEARED TO UTTER SOME ABSURDITY BEFORE SO MANY GRAND PEOPLE
60-121082-0007 AMONGST WHOM WITH DILATING EYES HE SAW THE KING'S ATTORNEY THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS WHO WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFF NECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON
60-121082-0008 AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNT MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS IN THE SOCIETY OF SOME NABOB COME TO PARIS TO FINISH THE WORLDLY EDUCATION OF HIS HEIR
60-121082-0009 HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER FOR THE MAJOR LIKE A PRUDENT MAN IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK NOTES HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET
60-121082-0010 THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
60-121082-0011 WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON ONE THING ABOVE ALL THE REST HEIGHTENED THE RESPECT
60-121082-0012 NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
60-121082-0013 BY DECLARING IN WHAT LAKE THE BEST LAMPREYS WERE CAUGHT THEN HE HAD EATEN SOME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD MORE
60-121082-0014 DANGLARS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH LUXURIES WERE COMMON AT THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHO MOST LIKELY IN LUCCA FED UPON TROUT BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND AND LOBSTERS SENT FROM ENGLAND
60-121082-0015 BY THE SAME MEANS USED BY THE COUNT TO BRING THE LAMPREYS FROM LAKE FUSARO AND THE STERLET FROM THE VOLGA THUS IT WAS WITH MUCH POLITENESS OF MANNER THAT HE HEARD CAVALCANTI PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS
60-121082-0016 TO MORROW SIR I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF WAITING UPON YOU ON BUSINESS AND I SIR SAID DANGLARS SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOU
60-121082-0017 IF IT WOULD NOT BE DEPRIVING HIM OF THE COMPANY OF HIS SON TO THIS CAVALCANTI REPLIED BY SAYING THAT FOR SOME TIME PAST HIS SON HAD LIVED INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM THAT HE HAD HIS OWN HORSES AND CARRIAGES
60-121082-0018 AND THAT NOT HAVING COME TOGETHER IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEAVE SEPARATELY THE MAJOR SEATED HIMSELF THEREFORE BY THE SIDE OF DANGLARS
60-121082-0019 WHO WAS MORE AND MORE CHARMED WITH THE IDEAS OF ORDER AND ECONOMY WHICH RULED THIS MAN AND YET WHO BEING ABLE TO ALLOW HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
60-121082-0020 AS FOR ANDREA HE BEGAN BY WAY OF SHOWING OFF TO SCOLD HIS GROOM WHO INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE TILBURY TO THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE HAD TAKEN IT TO THE OUTER DOOR THUS
60-121082-0021 GIVING HIM THE TROUBLE OF WALKING THIRTY STEPS TO REACH IT THE GROOM HEARD HIM WITH HUMILITY TOOK THE BIT OF THE IMPATIENT ANIMAL WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND WITH THE RIGHT HELD OUT THE REINS TO ANDREA
60-121082-0022 WHO TAKING THEM FROM HIM RESTED HIS POLISHED BOOT LIGHTLY ON THE STEP AT THAT MOMENT A HAND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER THE YOUNG MAN TURNED ROUND
60-121082-0023 AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
60-121082-0024 AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
60-121082-0025 TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
60-121082-0026 AND WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING ANDREA SAW SEEMED OF GIGANTIC SIZE DID THE YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IN HIS TILBURY
60-121082-0027 OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
60-121082-0028 HE ASKED PARDON ME MY FRIEND IF I DISTURB YOU SAID THE MAN WITH THE RED HANDKERCHIEF BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BEG AT NIGHT

60-121082-0035 AT THIS NAME NO DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN REFLECTED A LITTLE FOR HE WENT TOWARDS HIS GROOM SAYING THIS MAN IS RIGHT I DID INDEED CHARGE HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH HE MUST TELL ME WALK TO THE BARRIER

60-121082-0041 ANDREA LOOKED AROUND IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND THEN STOPPING THE HORSE AND CROSSING HIS ARMS BEFORE THE MAN HE ASKED NOW
