6019-3185-0000 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0001 RANGING UNCHAINED AMONG MEN SOMETHING TOO MEMORABLE TO BE FORGOTTEN OR LEFT WITHOUT ITS OWN SEPARATE RECORD BUT THE MORAL LESSON IMPRESSED BY THESE EVENTS IS YET MORE MEMORABLE
6019-3185-0002 AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
6019-3185-0003 AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
6019-3185-0004 I KNEW FAMILIARLY ALL THE PARTIES WHO WERE CONCERNED IN IT EITHER AS SUFFERERS OR AS AGENTS I WAS PRESENT FROM FIRST TO LAST AND WATCHED THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STORM WHICH FELL UPON OUR DEVOTED CITY
6019-3185-0005 IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
6019-3185-0006 BY SACRIFICING WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED THEM THEIR HOUSES AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS IN EXCHANGE FOR DAYS UNCURSED BY PANIC AND NIGHTS UNPOLLUTED BY BLOOD NOTHING I CAN TAKE UPON MYSELF TO ASSERT
6019-3185-0007 IN EVERY ONE OF WHICH THESE PRECAUTIONARY AIDS HAD FAILED TO YIELD THE SLIGHTEST ASSISTANCE THE HORROR THE PERFECT FRENZY OF FEAR WHICH SEIZED UPON THE TOWN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE BAFFLES ALL ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION
6019-3185-0008 THE ASTOUNDED POLICE AFTER AN EXAMINATION THE MOST SEARCHING PURSUED FROM DAY TO DAY
6019-3185-0009 HAD FINALLY PRONOUNCED THAT NO ATTEMPT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN MADE TO BENEFIT BY ANY OF THE SIGNALS PRECONCERTED THAT NO FOOTSTEP APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION THEN AND AFTER THAT RESULT
6019-3185-0010 AND THE GENERAL FEELING AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BY A GRAVE CITIZEN WHOM I MET IN A MORNING WALK FOR THE OVERMASTERING SENSE OF A PUBLIC CALAMITY BROKE DOWN EVERY BARRIER OF RESERVE AND ALL MEN TALKED FREELY TO ALL MEN IN THE STREETS
6019-3185-0011 AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE ROCKINGS OF AN EARTHQUAKE WAS EVEN AMONG THE BOLDEST LIKE THAT WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MIND IN DREAMS WHEN ONE FEELS ONESELF SLEEPING ALONE UTTERLY DIVIDED FROM ALL CALL OR HEARING OF FRIENDS
6019-3185-0012 DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
6019-3185-0013 WHISPERINGS AT A DISTANCE CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN DARKNESS AND DARKNESS LIKE ONE DEEP CALLING TO ANOTHER AND THE DREAMER'S OWN HEART THE CENTER FROM WHICH THE WHOLE NETWORK OF THIS UNIMAGINABLE CHAOS RADIATES
6019-3185-0014 AND IN WHICH THE HEART BEATS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH AN ENTIRE CITY THROUGH ALL ITS REGIONS OF HIGH AND LOW YOUNG AND OLD STRONG AND WEAK SUCH AGENCIES AVAIL TO RAISE AND TRANSFIGURE THE NATURES OF MEN
6019-3185-0015 IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE I HAD AN ADVANTAGE BEING UPON THE SPOT THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE AFFAIR FOR GIVING A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE AS I HAD STILL MORE EMINENTLY FROM THE SORT OF CENTRAL STATION WHICH I OCCUPIED
6019-3185-0016 WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CASE I MAY ADD THAT I HAD ANOTHER ADVANTAGE NOT POSSESSED OR NOT IN THE SAME DEGREE BY ANY OTHER INHABITANT OF THE TOWN I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH EVERY FAMILY OF THE SLIGHTEST ACCOUNT BELONGING TO THE RESIDENT POPULATION
6019-3185-0017 A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
6019-3185-0018 A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
6019-3185-0019 HOWEVER THOUGH SERVING IN THAT INSTANCE UNDER ENGLISH ORDERS AND ALTHOUGH AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ENGLISH MILITARY SERVICE HE HAS SERVED YOUNG AS HE IS
6019-3185-0020 WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS SOMEWHAT MOORISH COMPLEXION THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT OF A DEEPER TINGE THAN I HAVE SEEN AMONG MANY AN ENGLISHMAN HE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE NOBLEST LOOKING OF GOD'S CREATURES
6019-3185-0021 MISTER WYNDHAM'S SUCCESSION TO THE VAST FAMILY ESTATES IS INEVITABLE AND PROBABLY NEAR AT HAND MEANTIME HE IS ANXIOUS FOR SOME ASSISTANCE IN HIS STUDIES INTELLECTUALLY
6019-3185-0022 AS I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE SLOW TO DISCOVER BUT HIS LONG MILITARY SERVICE AND THE UNPARALLELED TUMULT OF OUR EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE EIGHTEEN O FIVE HAVE INTERFERED AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE WITH THE CULTIVATION OF HIS MIND
6019-3185-0023 FOR HE ENTERED THE CAVALRY SERVICE OF A GERMAN POWER WHEN A MERE BOY AND SHIFTED ABOUT FROM SERVICE TO SERVICE AS THE HURRICANE OF WAR BLEW FROM THIS POINT OR FROM THAT
6019-3185-0024 AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
6019-3185-0025 HE WAS TO KEEP A TABLE AND AN ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS AT HIS OWN COST WAS TO HAVE AN APARTMENT OF SOME DOZEN OR SO OF ROOMS THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE LIBRARY WITH SOME OTHER PUBLIC PRIVILEGES WILLINGLY CONCEDED BY THE MAGISTRACY OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0026 THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0027 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0028 NEXT AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK
6019-3185-0029 THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
6019-3185-0030 RADIANT WITH THE FAVOR OF COURTS AND OF IMPERIAL LADIES
6019-3185-0031 AN ANTINOUS OF FAULTLESS BEAUTY A GRECIAN STATUE AS IT WERE INTO WHICH THE BREATH OF LIFE HAD BEEN BREATHED BY SOME MODERN PYGMALION SUCH A POMP OF GIFTS AND ENDOWMENTS SETTLING UPON ONE MAN'S HEAD
6019-3185-0032 ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MY HOUSE I BECAME SENSIBLE OF A TRUTH WHICH I HAD OBSERVED SOME YEARS BEFORE THE COMMONPLACE MAXIM IS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO RAISE EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THIS
6019-3185-0033 WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
6019-3185-0034 IT IS ALWAYS USEFUL TO RACK THE EXPECTATION UP TO THE HIGHEST POINT IN ANYTHING WHICH PARTAKES OF THE INFINITE THE MOST UNLIMITED EXPECTATIONS WILL FIND AMPLE ROOM FOR GRATIFICATION WHILE IT IS CERTAIN THAT ORDINARY OBSERVERS POSSESSING LITTLE SENSIBILITY
6019-3185-0035 THE WARNING AT ANY RATE PUT ME ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHATEVER EMINENCE THERE MIGHT BE OF GRANDEUR IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THIS EXISTED IN SUCH EXCESS SO FAR TRANSCENDING ANYTHING I HAD EVER MET WITH IN MY EXPERIENCE
6019-3185-0036 THAT NO EXPECTATION WHICH IT IS IN WORDS TO RAISE COULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THESE THOUGHTS TRAVELED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHT THROUGH MY BRAIN AS AT ONE GLANCE MY EYE TOOK IN THE SUPREMACY OF BEAUTY AND POWER
6019-3185-0037 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ALIGHTED FROM THE CLOUDS BEFORE ME POWER AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF POWER IN ANY ABSOLUTE INCARNATION OF GRANDEUR OR EXCESS
6019-3185-0038 UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
6019-3185-0039 WERE TOO EMINENT TO ALLOW OF HIS BEING TREATED WITH LESS THAN THE HIGHEST ATTENTION IN ANY SOCIETY WHATEVER BUT THE EFFECT OF THESE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES ENFORCED AND RECOMMENDED AS THEY WERE BY A PERSONAL BEAUTY SO RARE
6019-3185-0040 WAS SOMEWHAT TOO POTENT FOR THE COMFORT AND SELF POSSESSION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND REALLY EXCEEDED IN A PAINFUL DEGREE THE STANDARD OF PRETENSIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH PEOPLE COULD FEEL THEMSELVES AT THEIR EASE HE WAS NOT NATURALLY OF A RESERVED TURN
6019-3185-0041 HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
6019-3185-0042 UNLESS WHEN IT WAS REVIVED BY STRENGTH OF FRIENDSHIP OR OF LOVE THE EFFECT WAS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO ALL PARTIES EVERY VOICE PAUSED OR FALTERED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
6019-3185-0043 NOT AN EYE BUT WAS DIRECTED UPON HIM OR ELSE SUNK IN TIMIDITY SETTLED UPON THE FLOOR AND YOUNG LADIES SERIOUSLY LOST THE POWER FOR A TIME OF DOING MORE THAN MURMURING A FEW CONFUSED HALF INARTICULATE SYLLABLES
6019-3185-0044 EITHER AS ACTORS OR SPECTATORS CERTAINLY THIS RESULT WAS NOT A PURE EFFECT OF MANLY BEAUTY HOWEVER HEROIC AND IN WHATEVER EXCESS IT AROSE IN PART FROM THE MANY AND EXTRAORDINARY ENDOWMENTS WHICH HAD CENTERED IN HIS PERSON
6019-3185-0045 WERE THERE THEN NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CONDITION OF AWESTRUCK ADMIRATION YES
6019-3185-0046 NEVER WAS THERE SO VICTORIOUS A CONQUEST INTERCHANGED BETWEEN TWO YOUTHFUL HEARTS NEVER BEFORE SUCH A RAPTURE OF INSTANTANEOUS SYMPATHY I DID NOT WITNESS THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS MAXIMILIAN AND THIS MAGNIFICENT MARGARET
6019-3185-0047 AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MARGARET MANIFESTED THAT TREPIDATION AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH DISTRESSED SO MANY OF HER YOUTHFUL CO RIVALS BUT IF SHE DID IT MUST HAVE FLED BEFORE THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S EYE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET PAST ALL MISUNDERSTANDING
6019-3185-0048 ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
6019-3185-0049 AND FOR A MERE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE HAD LONG TOO DEEPLY CONTEMPLATED FEARING HOWEVER THAT IN HIS OWN CASE IT MIGHT PROVE A CHIMERA OR THAT HE MIGHT NEVER MEET A WOMAN ANSWERING THE DEMANDS OF HIS HEART HE NOW FOUND A CORRESPONDING REALITY THAT LEFT NOTHING TO SEEK
6019-3185-0050 HERE THEN AND THUS FAR NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS HAD RESULTED FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN LITTLE ANTICIPATED BY MANY FAR LESS HAD I FOR MY PART ANTICIPATED THE UNHAPPY REVOLUTION WHICH WAS WROUGHT IN THE WHOLE NATURE
6019-3185-0051 WHO HAD DIED IN GIVING BIRTH TO THIS THIRD CHILD THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD LONG SURVIVED HER ANXIOUS THAT HIS SON SHOULD GO THROUGH A REGULAR COURSE OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUCTION NOW BECOMING ANNUALLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ALL THE ARTILLERY SERVICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE
6019-3185-0052 AND THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE A TINCTURE OF OTHER LIBERAL STUDIES WHICH HE HAD PAINFULLY MISSED IN HIS OWN MILITARY CAREER THE BARON CHOSE TO KEEP HIS SON FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AT OUR COLLEGE UNTIL HE WAS NOW ENTERING UPON HIS TWENTY THIRD YEAR
6019-3185-0053 FOR THE FOUR LAST HE HAD LIVED WITH ME AS THE SOLE PUPIL WHOM I HAD OR MEANT TO HAVE HAD NOT THE BRILLIANT PROPOSALS OF THE YOUNG RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN PERSUADED ME TO BREAK MY RESOLUTION FERDINAND VON HARRELSTEIN HAD GOOD TALENTS
6019-3185-0054 NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
6019-3185-0055 SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
6019-3185-0056 THAT SHE IT WAS WHO MUST BE HIS GOOD OR HIS EVIL GENIUS AT FIRST AND PERHAPS TO THE LAST I PITIED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BUT MY PITY SOON CEASED TO BE MINGLED WITH RESPECT
6019-3185-0057 AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
6019-3185-0058 STARTING FEARFUL AGITATED SOMETIMES HE BROKE OUT INTO MANIACAL MOVEMENTS OF WRATH INVOKING SOME ABSENT PERSON PRAYING BESEECHING MENACING SOME AIR WOVE PHANTOM
6019-3185-0059 FOR MORE THAN I SAW ENOUGH TO FEAR SOME FEARFUL CATASTROPHE LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION SAID HIS CONFESSOR TO HIM IN MY HEARING FOR THOUGH PRUSSIANS THE VON HARRELSTEINS WERE ROMAN CATHOLICS LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION
6019-3185-0060 REVEREND FATHER DO NOT YOU WITH THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING ME FROM TEMPTATION BE YOURSELF THE INSTRUMENT FOR TEMPTING ME INTO A REBELLION AGAINST THE CHURCH DO NOT YOU WEAVE SNARES ABOUT MY STEPS SNARES THERE ARE ALREADY AND BUT TOO MANY
6019-3185-0061 THE OLD MAN SIGHED AND DESISTED THEN CAME BUT ENOUGH FROM PITY FROM SYMPATHY FROM COUNSEL AND FROM CONSOLATION AND FROM SCORN
6019-3185-0062 WHOSE CONVENT STOOD NEAR THE CITY GATES THERE GOES ONE READY EQUALLY FOR DOING OR SUFFERING AND OF WHOM WE SHALL SOON HEAR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN SOME GREAT CATASTROPHE IT MAY BE OF DEEP CALAMITY
6019-3185-0063 FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
6019-3185-0064 THAT BEING GIVEN ON THE PART OF THE CITY EVERY STRANGER OF RANK WAS MARKED OUT AS A PRIVILEGED GUEST AND THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY AFFRONTED BY FAILING TO OFFER OR BY FAILING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION
6019-3185-0065 UPON THE EVENING AT WHICH I AM NOW ARRIVED THE TWENTY SECOND OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THE WHOLE CITY IN ITS WEALTHIER CLASSES WAS ASSEMBLED BENEATH THE ROOF OF A TRADESMAN WHO HAD THE HEART OF A PRINCE
6019-3185-0066 IN EVERY POINT OUR ENTERTAINMENT WAS SUPERB AND I REMARKED THAT THE MUSIC WAS THE FINEST I HAD HEARD FOR YEARS OUR HOST WAS IN JOYOUS SPIRITS PROUD TO SURVEY THE SPLENDID COMPANY HE HAD GATHERED UNDER HIS ROOF
6019-3185-0067 HAPPY TO WITNESS THEIR HAPPINESS ELATED IN THEIR ELATION JOYOUS WAS THE DANCE JOYOUS WERE ALL FACES THAT I SAW UP TO MIDNIGHT VERY SOON AFTER WHICH TIME SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED
6019-3185-0068 AND THAT ALSO I THINK WAS THE MOST JOYOUS OF ALL THE BANQUETS I EVER WITNESSED THE ACCOMPLISHED GUARDSMAN OUTSHONE HIMSELF IN BRILLIANCY EVEN HIS MELANCHOLY RELAXED IN FACT HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
6019-3185-0069 HANGING UPON HIS WORDS MORE LUSTROUS AND BEWITCHING THAN EVER I HAD BEHELD HER THERE SHE HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE HOST AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHY THAT IS ONE OF THE LUXURIES ATTACHED TO LOVE ALL MEN CEDE THEIR PLACES WITH PLEASURE
6019-3185-0070 WOMEN MAKE WAY EVEN SHE HERSELF KNEW THOUGH NOT OBLIGED TO KNOW WHY SHE WAS SEATED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOOK HER PLACE IF WITH A ROSY SUFFUSION UPON HER CHEEKS YET WITH FULLNESS OF HAPPINESS AT HER HEART
6019-3185-0071 THE MUSIC AGAIN BEGAN TO POUR ITS VOLUPTUOUS TIDES THROUGH THE BOUNDING PULSES OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANY AGAIN THE FLYING FEET OF THE DANCERS BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE MEASURES
6019-3185-0072 AGAIN THE MOUNTING SPIRIT OF DELIGHT BEGAN TO FILL THE SAILS OF THE HURRYING NIGHT WITH STEADY INSPIRATION ALL WENT HAPPILY ALREADY HAD ONE DANCE FINISHED SOME WERE PACING UP AND DOWN LEANING ON THE ARMS OF THEIR PARTNERS
6019-3185-0073 SOME WERE REPOSING FROM THEIR EXERTIONS WHEN O HEAVENS WHAT A SHRIEK WHAT A GATHERING TUMULT EVERY EYE WAS BENT TOWARD THE DOORS EVERY EYE STRAINED FORWARD TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS PASSING
6019-3185-0074 BUT THERE EVERY MOMENT LESS AND LESS COULD BE SEEN FOR THE GATHERING CROWD MORE AND MORE INTERCEPTED THE VIEW SO MUCH THE MORE WAS THE EAR AT LEISURE FOR THE SHRIEKS REDOUBLED UPON SHRIEKS MISS LIEBENHEIM HAD MOVED DOWNWARD TO THE CROWD
6019-3185-0075 AND HAD LIVED WITH HER UNCLE A TRADESMAN NOT TEN DOORS FROM MARGARET'S OWN RESIDENCE PARTLY ON THE TERMS OF A KINSWOMAN PARTLY AS A SERVANT ON TRIAL AT THIS MOMENT SHE WAS EXHAUSTED WITH EXCITEMENT AND THE NATURE OF THE SHOCK SHE HAD SUSTAINED
6019-3185-0076 MERE PANIC SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED HER AND SHE WAS LEANING UNCONSCIOUS AND WEEPING UPON THE SHOULDER OF SOME GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO SOOTHE HER A SILENCE OF HORROR SEEMED TO POSSESS THE COMPANY
6019-3185-0077 MOST OF WHOM WERE STILL UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ALARMING INTERRUPTION A FEW HOWEVER WHO HAD HEARD HER FIRST AGITATED WORDS
6019-3185-0078 NOW RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY OUT OF THE BALLROOM TO SATISFY THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT THE DISTANCE WAS NOT GREAT AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SEVERAL PERSONS RETURNED HASTILY AND CRIED OUT TO THE CROWD OF LADIES THAT ALL WAS TRUE WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SAID
6019-3185-0079 WHAT WAS TRUE THAT HER UNCLE MISTER WEISHAUPT'S FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SPARED NAMELY MISTER WEISHAUPT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE NEITHER OF THEM MUCH ABOVE SIXTY
6019-3185-0080 BUT BOTH INFIRM BEYOND THEIR YEARS TWO MAIDEN SISTERS OF MISTER WEISHAUPT FROM FORTY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND AN ELDERLY FEMALE DOMESTIC
6019-3185-0081 AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
6019-3185-0082 AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE GROUND BUT FOR MAXIMILIAN WHO SPRANG FORWARD AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS SHE WAS LONG OF RETURNING TO HERSELF AND DURING THE AGONY OF HIS SUSPENSE HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER PALLID LIPS
6019-3185-0083 THAT SIGHT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE BORNE BY ONE WHO STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND THE GROUP HE RUSHED FORWARD WITH EYES GLARING LIKE A TIGER'S AND LEVELED A BLOW AT MAXIMILIAN IT WAS POOR MANIACAL VON HARRELSTEIN
6019-3185-0084 MANY PEOPLE STEPPED FORWARD AND CHECKED HIS ARM UPLIFTED FOR A REPETITION OF THIS OUTRAGE ONE OR TWO HAD SOME INFLUENCE WITH HIM AND LED HIM AWAY FROM THE SPOT
6019-3185-0085 WHILE AS TO MAXIMILIAN SO ABSORBED WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS PERCEIVED THE AFFRONT OFFERED TO HIMSELF MARGARET ON REVIVING WAS CONFOUNDED AT FINDING HERSELF SO SITUATED AMID A GREAT CROWD
6019-3185-0086 AND YET THE PRUDES COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A LOOK OF LOVE EXCHANGED BETWEEN HERSELF AND MAXIMILIAN THAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ESCAPED HER IN SUCH A SITUATION IF THEY MEANT BY SUCH A SITUATION ONE SO PUBLIC
6019-3185-0087 THAT IT WAS A SITUATION OF EXCESSIVE AGITATION BUT IF THEY ALLUDED TO THE HORRORS OF THE MOMENT NO SITUATION MORE NATURALLY OPENS THE HEART TO AFFECTION AND CONFIDING LOVE THAN THE RECOIL FROM SCENES OF EXQUISITE TERROR
6019-3185-0088 WERE MARKED BY THE COOLEST NAY THE MOST SNEERING INDIFFERENCE THE FIRST THING HE DID ON BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST HIMSELF WAS TO LAUGH FEROCIOUSLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE MOST CORDIALLY AND UNAFFECTEDLY
6019-3185-0089 GOLD REPEATERS MASSY PLATE GOLD SNUFF BOXES UNTOUCHED THAT ARGUMENT CERTAINLY WEIGHED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR AND YET AGAIN IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR A MAGISTRATE ASKED HIM HOW HE HAPPENED TO KNOW ALREADY THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
6019-3185-0090 TRUE IT WAS AND A FACT WHICH HAD PUZZLED NO LESS THAN IT HAD AWED THE MAGISTRATES THAT UPON THEIR EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES MANY RICH ARTICLES OF BIJOUTERIE JEWELRY AND PERSONAL ORNAMENTS HAD BEEN FOUND LYING UNDERANGED
6019-3185-0091 FOR THE PRIVATE CELEBRATION OF MASS THIS CRUCIFIX AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE LITTLE CLOSET
6019-3185-0092 FOR HITHER HAD ONE OF THE LADIES FLED HITHER HAD ONE OF THE MURDERERS PURSUED SHE HAD CLASPED THE GOLDEN PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ALTAR HAD TURNED PERHAPS HER DYING LOOKS UPON THE CRUCIFIX
6019-3185-0093 FOR THERE WITH ONE ARM STILL WREATHED ABOUT THE ALTAR FOOT THOUGH IN HER AGONY SHE HAD TURNED ROUND UPON HER FACE DID THE ELDER SISTER LIE WHEN THE MAGISTRATES FIRST BROKE OPEN THE STREET DOOR AND UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PARQUET
6019-3185-0094 OR INLAID FLOOR WHICH RAN ROUND THE ROOM WERE STILL IMPRESSED THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MURDERER THESE IT WAS HOPED MIGHT FURNISH A CLEW TO THE DISCOVERY OF ONE AT LEAST AMONG THE MURDEROUS BAND THEY WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO TRACE ACCURATELY
6019-3185-0095 THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
6019-3185-0096 FOR THE FOOTSTEPS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUTLINE FROM HIS AND SMALLER FOR AARON WAS A MAN OF COLOSSAL BUILD
6019-3185-0097 AND AS TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES HAD BEEN FOUND AND HIS HAVING SO FAMILIARLY RELIED UPON THE FACT OF NO ROBBERY HAVING TAKEN PLACE AS AN ARGUMENT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
6019-3185-0098 HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
6019-3185-0099 THAT IN FACT HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH FOR HIS ARGUMENT BEFORE HE AND THE REST OF THE MOB HAD BEEN EJECTED BY THE MAGISTRATES BUT FINALLY THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL THIS HE HAD HEARD BOTH THE OFFICERS AS THEY CONDUCTED HIM
6019-3185-0100 IN SIX WEEKS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF THIS TERRIFIC EVENT THE NEGRO WAS SET AT LIBERTY BY A MAJORITY OF VOICES AMONG THE MAGISTRATES IN THAT SHORT INTERVAL OTHER EVENTS HAD OCCURRED NO LESS TERRIFIC AND MYSTERIOUS
6019-3185-0101 ATTACKED THEM SINGLY IN FLIGHT FOR IN THIS FIRST CASE ALL BUT ONE OF THE MURDERED PERSONS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THE STREET DOOR AND IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NO SUBJECT FOR WONDER EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE AS TO THE MOTIVE
6019-3185-0102 IN SAD LEISURELY OR IN TERRIFIC GROUPS SEEMED TO ARGUE A LETHARGY LIKE THAT OF APOPLEXY IN THE VICTIMS ONE AND ALL THE VERY MIDNIGHT OF MYSTERIOUS AWE FELL UPON ALL MINDS
6019-3185-0103 THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE THE MURDER AT MISTER WEISHAUPT'S THREE WEEKS THE MOST AGITATED THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN IN THIS SEQUESTERED CITY WE FELT OURSELVES SOLITARY AND THROWN UPON OUR OWN RESOURCES
6019-3185-0104 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0105 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL TO DISTRESS THE MOST TIMID WHILE TO YOUNG AND HIGH SPIRITED PEOPLE WITH COURAGE TO SPARE FOR ORDINARY TRIALS
6019-3185-0106 BUT MURDERERS EXTERMINATING MURDERERS CLOTHED IN MYSTERY AND UTTER DARKNESS THESE WERE OBJECTS TOO TERRIFIC FOR ANY FAMILY TO CONTEMPLATE WITH FORTITUDE
6019-3185-0107 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0109 NO MAN COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT MUST MAKE HIM OBNOXIOUS TO THE MURDERERS IMAGINATION EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VAIN GUESSES AT THE CAUSES WHICH COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE MADE THE POOR WEISHAUPTS OBJECTS OF SUCH HATRED TO ANY MAN
6019-3185-0110 TRUE THEY WERE BIGOTED IN A DEGREE WHICH INDICATED FEEBLENESS OF INTELLECT BUT THAT WOUNDED NO MAN IN PARTICULAR WHILE TO MANY IT RECOMMENDED THEM TRUE THEIR CHARITY WAS NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE BUT TO THOSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BODY IT EXPANDED MUNIFICENTLY
6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS
