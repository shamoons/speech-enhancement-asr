6064-56165-0000 HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
6064-56165-0001 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0003 AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
6064-56165-0004 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD
6064-56165-0005 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
6064-56165-0006 YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
6064-56165-0007 WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
6064-56165-0008 NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
6064-56165-0009 HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
6064-56165-0010 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
6064-56165-0012 OH SAY DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TIME WILL HARDON HAD WITH THE DICKY LAST WEEK HE ASKED NORA NODDED SHE TOO HAD A BROTHER IN COLLEGE WHAT WAS IT ASKED EDITH YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME PHILIP

6064-56165-0014 AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT HIM OH SAID ONE GIRL AND AH SAID ANOTHER AND HOW SILLY THEY ALL CRIED TOGETHER IF GIRLS AMUSED THEMSELVES LIKE THAT WHAT FUN YOU'D MAKE OF US SAID THE PRACTICAL NORA
6064-56165-0015 OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0017 HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
6064-56165-0018 HE WALKED OFF AS NICE AS YOU PLEASE WASN'T HE MAD AT THE TWO FELLOWS FOR TAKING HIM THERE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S A PART OF THE THING WHY THERE ARE FELLOWS IN CAMBRIDGE WHO WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
6064-56165-0019 OR STAND ON THEIR HEADS IN FRONT OF A PULPIT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING INTO THE DICKY I TELL YOU WE MAKE SOME OF THEM SUFFER
6064-56165-0020 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
6064-56165-0021 THERE ARE A LOT OF GIRLS STUDYING IN CAMBRIDGE NOW AT THE ANNEX AND THE FELLOWS DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL WELL I DECLARE EXCLAIMED NORA I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES TO THEM
6064-56165-0022 OH THEY HATE TO SEE THESE GIRLS GOING ABOUT WITH BOOKS AND TRYING TO GET INTO HARVARD YES TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS SAID NORA SARCASTICALLY

6064-56165-0024 INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
6064-56165-0025 WELL I WISH MYSELF THAT OUR ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR HADN'T SUCH A FONDNESS FOR READING THEMES TO US THAT THE GIRLS HAVE WRITTEN HE MAKES OUT THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN OURS BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT MYSELF WHO GETS THE BEST MARKS
6064-56165-0026 DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
6064-56165-0027 A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP

6064-56165-0030 PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6064-56165-0031 THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6064-56165-0032 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0033 REPLIED PHILIP'S SISTER IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS JUST A LITTLE PALE HE IS ALWAYS PALE SAID EDITH DO YOU SUPPOSE HE SITS UP TOO LATE ASKED BRENDA I'LL WARRANT HE DOESN'T STUDY TOO MUCH SAID BELLE
6064-56165-0034 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56165-0035 HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
6064-56165-0036 HASTILY INTERPOSED BELLE BOYS NEVER LIKE A GIRL WHO STUDIES ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS GOING TO COLLEGE WELL JULIA IS JUST THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW SAID NORA REPEATING THE WORDS SHE HAD USED TO PHILIP
