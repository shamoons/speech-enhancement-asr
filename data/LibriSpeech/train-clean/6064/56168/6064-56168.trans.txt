6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0001 IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
6064-56168-0002 AND THOSE WHO HAD RELATIVES IN THE TEAM WERE TOO PROUD FOR ANYTHING AS BRENDA SAID THE GAME WAS TO BE PLAYED IN HOLMES FIELD AND TICKETS WERE NOT EASY TO GET BECAUSE THE SEATS WERE FAR LESS NUMEROUS THAN NOW ON THE GREAT SOLDIERS FIELD
6064-56168-0003 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0005 AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
6064-56168-0006 FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
6064-56168-0008 EXCEPT THAT YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE WE MIGHT NOT CARE TO HAVE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD SAID BELLE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT BROKE IN BRENDA RATHER SNAPPISHLY I WILL JUST TELL EDITH WHAT I THINK
6064-56168-0009 IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
6064-56168-0010 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0011 IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE JULIA TAGGING ABOUT EVERYWHERE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD HAVE RUTH ROBERTS WHEN WE NEVER SEE HER ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT SCHOOL I REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU AND NORA CAN LIKE IT EITHER WHY
6064-56168-0012 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0014 THEN BELLE ADDED A FINAL WORD OH IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ALL JULIA'S DOINGS
6064-56168-0015 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0016 AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
6064-56168-0017 YES I KNOW BUT STILL THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED SAID NORA THOUGH TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE QUOTATION DID NOT SOUND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED
6064-56168-0018 I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
6064-56168-0019 I SHOULD CALL IT VERY IMPOLITE IF THERE WERE NO ORANGE FLAGS SHOWN AT THE GAME WELL YOU HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEAS HASN'T SHE BRENDA BRENDA NODDED ASSENT AND NORA CONTINUED
6064-56168-0020 WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0021 OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
6064-56168-0022 WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
6064-56168-0023 RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
6064-56168-0024 THAT THEY WERE VERY SELFISH IN LEAVING THEIR SCHOOLMATE SO ENTIRELY TO HERSELF IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE HER THEY WERE MERELY SO VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THAT THEY HARDLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS OFTEN LEFT TO HERSELF
6064-56168-0025 RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
6064-56168-0026 AND WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN JOINING THEM NO ONE GETS A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT FROM READING A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOOK AND SO IT IS OFTEN HARD TO BE A MERE LISTENER
6064-56168-0027 WHEN THE TONGUES OF HALF A DOZEN GIRLS ARE VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSING PEOPLE AND EVENTS OF WHICH THE LISTENER HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE RUTH HERSELF WAS VERY INDEPENDENT
6064-56168-0028 SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
6064-56168-0029 HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE AND IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DELIGHT TO HER TO HAVE THE LATTER PLACED WITH HER IN ONE OR TWO SPECIAL CLASSES JULIA'S LIKING FOR HER HAD MADE EDITH TAKE A LITTLE MORE INTEREST IN HER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
6064-56168-0030 NO ONE WHO SAW THE HEARTY WAY IN WHICH NORA AND BRENDA GREETED RUTH AS SHE CAME UP WITH EDITH AND JULIA COULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION THE MERCURIAL BRENDA FOR THE MOMENT
6064-56168-0031 WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
6064-56168-0032 THE LATTER EXPRESSED HER THANKS IN A GLANCE TOWARDS HER COUSIN AS RUTH ACCEPTED VERY GRACEFULLY AND NORA EXCLAIMED WHAT FUN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
6064-56168-0033 OH DEAR I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SATURDAY I KNOW IT REPLIED BRENDA IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK TOO BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME
