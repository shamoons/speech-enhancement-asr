6078-54007-0013 THEN AWAY HE FLEW TO ATTEND TO OTHER MATTERS OF GREATER NEED WHEN THE FIDDLER HAD GATHERED HIS WITS TOGETHER AND HIMSELF TO HIS FEET HE SAW THAT HE LAY IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES AND MARBLE WALKS AND WHAT NOT
6078-54007-0014 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0015 HE ENTERED THE DOOR AND NOBODY SAID NO TO HIM THEN HE PASSED THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER AND EACH WAS FINER THAN THE ONE HE LEFT BEHIND MANY SERVANTS STOOD AROUND BUT THEY ONLY BOWED AND NEVER ASKED WHENCE HE CAME
6078-54007-0016 THE TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH A FEAST THAT SMELLED SO GOOD THAT IT BROUGHT TEARS TO THE FIDDLER'S EYES AND WATER TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL THE PLATES WERE OF PURE GOLD THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAT ALONE BUT ANOTHER PLACE WAS SPREAD
6078-54007-0017 DO NOT SAY THAT SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND EAT AND WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL YOU WILL SAY IT WAS NOT ILL LUCK BUT GOOD LUCK THAT BROUGHT YOU THE FIDDLER HAD HIS OWN MIND ABOUT THAT BUT ALL THE SAME DOWN HE SAT AT THE TABLE
6078-54007-0018 AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
6078-54007-0019 AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
6078-54007-0020 AND SO YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME AS LONG AS I LIVE AND AFTER I AM GONE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SHALL BE YOURS THE FIDDLER DID NOTHING BUT STARE WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER SHUT EITHER AGAIN
6078-54007-0021 EVERYTHING THE FIDDLER WANTED CAME TO HIS HAND HE LIVED HIGH AND SLEPT SOFT AND WARM AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO WANT EITHER MORE OR LESS OR GREAT OR SMALL IN ALL OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE DID NOTHING BUT ENJOY HIMSELF
6078-54007-0022 WITH MIGHT AND MAIN BUT BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE ALL THE GOOD THINGS CAME FROM THEN BEFORE LONG HE FELL TO PESTERING THE OLD MAN WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MATTER AT FIRST THE OLD MAN PUT HIM OFF WITH SHORT ANSWERS
6078-54007-0023 BUT THE FIDDLER WAS A MASTER HAND AT FINDING OUT ANYTHING HE WANTED TO KNOW HE DINNED AND DRUMMED AND WORRIED UNTIL FLESH AND BLOOD COULD STAND IT NO LONGER SO AT LAST THE OLD MAN SAID THAT HE WOULD SHOW HIM THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE ALL HIS WEALTH CAME FROM
6078-54007-0024 AND AT THAT THE FIDDLER WAS TICKLED BEYOND MEASURE
6078-54007-0025 THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
6078-54007-0026 DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
6078-54007-0027 YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THAT DOOR YONDER AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOULD YOU DO SO ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU OH NO THE FIDDLER WOULD NEVER THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING AS OPENING THE DOOR
6078-54007-0028 AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
6078-54007-0029 PERHAPS I CAN SEE WHAT IS THERE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR SO DOWN HE TOOK THE KEY AND OFF HE MARCHED TO THE GARDEN HE OPENED THE TRAP DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE STEEP STEPS TO THE ROOM BELOW THERE WAS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM
6078-54007-0030 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
6078-54007-0031 HE HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE WAVES BEATING ON THE SHORE WELL SAYS HE THIS IS THE MOST CURIOUS THING I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE COME SO FAR I MAY AS WELL SEE THE END OF IT
6078-54007-0032 SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
6078-54007-0033 THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0034 BY AND BY HE MANAGED TO SCREW HIS HEAD AROUND AND LOOK UP AND THERE IT WAS ILL LUCK THAT HAD HIM I THOUGHT SO SAID THE FIDDLER AND THEN HE GAVE OVER KICKING WELL ON AND ON THEY FLEW OVER HILL AND VALLEY OVER MOOR AND MOUNTAIN
6078-54007-0035 UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
6078-54007-0036 AND ALL HAD BEEN WEEPING AND WOE THOUGH THEY WERE BEGINNING NOW TO PICK UP THEIR SMILES AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD DIED AND NO ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND HIM BUT THE QUEEN
6078-54007-0037 AND SO SHE HAD COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN FOR A BIT OF REST AND THERE SHE SAT UNDER THE SHADE OF AN APPLE TREE FANNING HERSELF AND CRYING WHEN SWASH DOWN FELL THE FIDDLER INTO THE APPLE TREE AND DOWN FELL A DOZEN APPLES
6078-54007-0038 YOU FELL FROM HEAVEN FOR I SAW IT WITH MY EYES AND HEARD IT WITH MY EARS I SEE HOW IT IS NOW YOU WERE SENT HITHER FROM HEAVEN TO BE MY HUSBAND AND MY HUSBAND YOU SHALL BE YOU SHALL BE KING OF THIS COUNTRY HALF AND HALF WITH ME AS QUEEN
6078-54007-0039 AND SHALL SIT ON A THRONE BESIDE ME YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE FIDDLER'S EARS SO THE PRINCES WERE SENT PACKING AND THE FIDDLER WAS MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND REIGNED IN THAT COUNTRY WELL THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED
6078-54007-0040 AND ALL WAS AS SWEET AND HAPPY AS A SPRING DAY BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE FIDDLER BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE CASTLE THE QUEEN WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SHOW HIM ALL THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE TO BE SEEN
6078-54007-0041 YOU MUST NOT ASK OR WISH TO KNOW SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU POOH SAID THE FIDDLER I DON'T CARE TO KNOW ANYHOW AND OFF THEY WENT HAND IN HAND YES
6078-54007-0042 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
6078-54007-0043 WHY LOOK SAYS HE IT IS JUST LIKE THE DOOR AT THE RICH MAN'S HOUSE OVER YONDER I WONDER IF IT IS THE SAME INSIDE AS OUTSIDE AND HE OPENED THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN YES THERE WAS THE LONG PASSAGE
6078-54007-0044 AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE SHINING HE COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LISTENED YES SAID HE I THINK I HEAR THE WATER RUSHING BUT I AM NOT SURE I WILL JUST GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN
6078-54007-0045 AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
6078-54007-0046 AWAY FLEW THE FIDDLER LIKE A BULLET AND THERE WAS ILL LUCK CARRYING HIM BY THE BELT AGAIN AWAY THEY SPED
6078-54007-0047 UNTIL THE FIDDLER'S HEAD GREW SO DIZZY THAT HE HAD TO SHUT HIS EYES SUDDENLY ILL LUCK LET HIM DROP AND DOWN HE FELL THUMP BUMP ON THE HARD GROUND THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAT UP
6078-54007-0048 OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
6078-54007-0049 I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
6078-54007-0050 AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
