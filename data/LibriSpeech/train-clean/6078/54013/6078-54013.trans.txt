6078-54013-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SERVANT WHO SERVED A WISE MAN
6078-54013-0001 DAY AFTER DAY TIME IN AND TIME OUT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THOSE YEARS THE SERVANT WAS WELL ENOUGH CONTENTED BUT NO ONE LIKES TO ABIDE IN THE SAME PLACE FOREVER AND SO ONE DAY HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
6078-54013-0002 TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A FORTUNE A MAN MIGHT MAKE THERE FOR HIMSELF
6078-54013-0003 YOU HAVE SERVED ME FAITHFULLY THESE SEVEN YEARS GONE AND NOW THAT YOU ASK LEAVE TO GO YOU SHALL GO BUT IT IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MONEY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT I CAN AFFORD
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0005 PAYING HIS WAY WITH THE FEW PENNIES HE HAD SAVED IN HIS SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRAVELLING NOTHING OF GOOD HAPPENED TO HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE CAME TO A LONELY PLACE WHERE THERE STOOD A GALLOWS AND THERE HE SAT HIM DOWN TO REST
6078-54013-0006 AND IT IS JUST IN SUCH AN UNLIKELY PLACE AS THIS THAT A MAN'S BEST CHANCE OF FORTUNE COMES TO HIM SOMETIMES AS THE SERVANT SAT THERE THERE CAME TWO RAVENS FLYING AND LIT UPON THE CROSS BEAM OVERHEAD
6078-54013-0007 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0008 WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0009 AND THERE HE WOULD FIND A MAN SITTING
6078-54013-0010 THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
6078-54013-0011 THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS SAID THE FIRST RAVEN AND OF WHAT USE WOULD THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS BE TO HIM
6078-54013-0012 AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
6078-54013-0013 AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
6078-54013-0014 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0015 AND SAY NOT A WORD DO YOU AGREE TO THAT YES SAID THE SERVANT I DO VERY WELL SAID HIS NEW COMRADE THEN LET US BE JOGGING
6078-54013-0016 AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
6078-54013-0017 THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
6078-54013-0018 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET
6078-54013-0019 TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0020 WHERE DOZENS OF SERVANTS WERE SERVING A FINE FEAST BUT ONLY ONE MAN SAT AT TABLE A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE SO SORROWFUL THAT IT MADE A BODY'S HEART ACHE TO LOOK UPON HIM CAN YOU PLAY GOOD MUSIC PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0021 BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0022 THEREUPON HE DREW OUT HIS PIPES AND BEGAN TO PLAY AND IT WAS SUCH A TUNE AS NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE HE PLAYED AND HE PLAYED AND AFTER A WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM BEGAN TO GET DROWSY FIRST THEY WINKED
6078-54013-0023 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0024 THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0026 TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
6078-54013-0027 NONE WAS MORE UGLY THAN THIS TO BEWITCH THE POOR SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN INTO A SLEEP AND THEN TO ROB HIM OF HIS RUBY RING
6078-54013-0028 BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY JOGGED ON TOGETHER AGAIN UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST THERE THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN TILL NIGHT CAME UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM STILL STUMBLING ONWARD THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6078-54013-0029 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0030 UP STEPPED THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR RAP TAP TAP BY AND BY IT WAS OPENED A CRACK AND THERE STOOD AN UGLY OLD WOMAN BLEAR EYED AND CROOKED AND GNARLED AS A WINTER TWIG
6078-54013-0031 NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WE CAN GO NO FARTHER TO NIGHT SO YOU MUST LET US IN AND HIDE US AS BEST YOU MAY AND IN HE WENT AS HE SAID WITH THE SERVANT AT HIS HEELS
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
6078-54013-0033 BY AND BY IN CAME THE GANG OF THIEVES WITH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR AND DOWN THEY SAT TO THEIR SUPPER
6078-54013-0034 HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
6078-54013-0035 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
6078-54013-0036 THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
6078-54013-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0038 AND THERE THE COMRADE KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR AND ASKED FOR LODGING
6078-54013-0039 NEVERTHELESS THEY MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM THE VERY BEST THAT WAS TO BE HAD IN THE HOUSE AND AFTER BOTH HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THEY SHOWED THEM TO BED IN A CORNER AS CLEAN AS SNOW AND THERE THEY SLEPT THE NIGHT THROUGH
6078-54013-0040 BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
6078-54013-0041 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
6078-54013-0042 HE GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND STICKS OF WOOD AND STUFFED ALL UNDER THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THEN HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND SET FIRE TO IT
6078-54013-0043 ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
6078-54013-0044 ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
6078-54013-0045 IN THIS COTTAGE LIVED A WIDOW AND HER ONLY SON AND THEY ALSO MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM A GOOD SUPPER AND SHOWED THEM TO A CLEAN BED THIS TIME THE TRAVELLING COMRADE DID NEITHER GOOD NOR ILL TO THOSE OF THE HOUSE
6078-54013-0046 BUT IN THE MORNING HE TOLD THE WIDOW WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND ASKED IF SHE AND HER SON KNEW THE WAY TO THE GARDEN WHERE GREW THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS YES SAID SHE THAT WE DO FOR THE GARDEN IS NOT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM HERE
6078-54013-0047 AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
6078-54013-0048 AND OFF WENT THE THREE UP HILL AND DOWN DALE UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME OVER THE TOP OF THE LAST HILL AND THERE BELOW THEM LAY THE GARDEN AND WHAT A SIGHT IT WAS THE LEAVES SHINING AND GLISTENING LIKE SO MANY JEWELS IN THE SUNLIGHT
6078-54013-0049 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
6078-54013-0050 TORRENT WITHOUT A BRIDGE FOR A BODY TO CROSS OVER YONDER IS WHAT YOU SEEK SAID THE YOUNG MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0051 BUT SUDDENLY CATCHING THE WIDOW'S SON BY THE COLLAR HE LIFTED HIM AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE BLACK RUSHING WATER SPLASH WENT THE YOUNG MAN AND THEN AWAY HE WENT WHIRLING OVER ROCKS AND WATER FALLS THERE CRIED THE COMRADE
6078-54013-0052 THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
6078-54013-0053 HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
6078-54013-0054 SUCH ABUSE AS HE SHOWERED UPON HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE BUT TO ALL THE SERVANT SAID THE OTHER ANSWERED NEVER A WORD UNTIL HE HAD STOPPED FOR SHEER WANT OF BREATH THEN POOR FOOL SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0055 THEREUPON AS HE ENDED SPEAKING HE STRUCK HIS STAFF UPON THE GROUND INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE SKY DARKENED OVERHEAD UNTIL IT GREW AS BLACK AS NIGHT
6078-54013-0056 THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
6078-54013-0057 BUT WHAT A CHANGE HE BEHELD IT WAS A POOR COTTAGE NO LONGER BUT A SPLENDID PALACE FIT FOR A QUEEN TO DWELL IN
6078-54013-0058 AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
6078-54013-0059 AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
6078-54013-0060 BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
6078-54013-0061 THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL SET FIRE TO THERE HE BEHELD MASONS AND CARPENTERS HARD AT WORK HACKING AND HEWING AND BUILDING A FINE NEW HOUSE AND THERE HE SAW THE POOR MAN HIMSELF STANDING BY GIVING THEM ORDERS HOW IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0062 FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
6078-54013-0063 THE NEXT MORNING THE POOR SERVANT JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY MORE SAD AND DOWNCAST THAN EVER AND BY EVENING HE HAD COME TO THE ROBBERS DEN IN THE THICK WOODS AND THERE THE OLD WOMAN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
6078-54013-0064 HE GAVE IT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND AND AFTER HE HAD GONE THE ROBBERS FOUGHT FOR IT WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL KILLED SO NOW THE WORLD IS RID OF THEM AND TRAVELLERS CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE BACK JOGGED THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0065 AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
6078-54013-0066 THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
6078-54013-0067 INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
