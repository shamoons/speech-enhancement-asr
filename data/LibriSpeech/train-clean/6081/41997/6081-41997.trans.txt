6081-41997-0000 HENCE THE DRIVER'S HOPE OF FINDING THEM IN THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE
6081-41997-0001 AND YET HE DID NOT HESITATE TO JUMP ON TO THE BOX AND GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR STARTING IN SO DOING HE OBEYED A MAXIM WHICH HE HAD
6081-41997-0002 A MAXIM INTENDED TO ASSURE HIS AFTER FAME AND WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS ALWAYS SUSPECT THAT WHICH SEEMS PROBABLE AND BEGIN BY BELIEVING WHAT APPEARS INCREDIBLE
6081-41997-0003 AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE YOUNG DETECTIVE PROCEEDED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF INTO THE DRIVER'S GOOD GRACES BEING ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THIS WORTHY WAS ABLE TO IMPART
6081-41997-0004 IN A TONE THAT IMPLIED THAT ALL TRIFLING WOULD BE USELESS THE CABMAN CRIED HEY UP HEY UP COCOTTE AND HIS MARE PRICKED UP HER EARS AND QUICKENED HER PACE SO THAT THE RUE DE CHOISY
6081-41997-0005 WAS SPEEDILY REACHED THEN IT WAS THAT LECOQ RESUMED HIS INQUIRIES WELL MY GOOD FELLOW HE BEGAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME THE PRINCIPAL FACTS NOW I SHOULD LIKE THE DETAILS
6081-41997-0006 HOW DID THESE TWO WOMEN ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION
6081-41997-0007 I HAD BEEN HAVING A MOST UNFORTUNATE DAY SIX HOURS ON A STAND ON THE BOULEVARDS WITH THE RAIN POURING ALL THE TIME IT WAS SIMPLY AWFUL AT MIDNIGHT I HAD NOT MADE MORE THAN A FRANC AND A
6081-41997-0008 HALF FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS SO WET AND MISERABLE AND THE HORSE SEEMED SO DONE UP THAT I DECIDED TO GO HOME I DID GRUMBLE I CAN TELL YOU WELL I HAD JUST PASSED THE CORNER OF THE RUE PICARD
6081-41997-0009 WHEN I SAW TWO WOMEN STANDING UNDER A LAMP SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR WHEN A MAN IS AS OLD AS I AM WOMEN GO ON SAID LECOQ WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE
6081-41997-0010 I HAD ALREADY PASSED THEM WHEN THEY BEGAN TO CALL AFTER ME I PRETENDED I DID NOT HEAR THEM BUT ONE OF THEM RAN AFTER THE CAB CRYING
6081-41997-0011 A LOUIS FOR YOURSELF I HESITATED FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE WOMAN ADDED AND TEN FRANCS FOR THE FARE I THEN DREW UP LECOQ WAS BOILING OVER WITH IMPATIENCE BUT HE FELT THAT THE WISEST COURSE WAS NOT TO INTERRUPT THE DRIVER WITH QUESTIONS
6081-41997-0012 BUT TO LISTEN TO ALL HE HAD TO SAY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE CONTINUED THE COACHMAN I WASN'T INCLINED TO TRUST TWO SUCH SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS ALONE AT THAT HOUR AND IN THAT PART OF THE CITY
6081-41997-0013 SO JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO GET INTO THE CAB I CALLED TO THEM WAIT A BIT MY LITTLE FRIENDS YOU HAVE PROMISED PAPA SOME SOUS WHERE ARE THEY THE ONE WHO HAD CALLED AFTER THE CAB AT ONCE HANDED ME THIRTY FRANCS
6081-41997-0014 SAYING ABOVE ALL MAKE HASTE YOUR RECITAL COULD NOT BE MORE MINUTE EXCLAIMED LECOQ APPROVINGLY NOW HOW ABOUT THESE TWO WOMEN
6081-41997-0015 WHICH RAN AFTER YOU THE GIRL WHO WAS NEATLY DRESSED THE ONE WHO THE DRIVER SUDDENLY PAUSED SOME VIVID REMEMBRANCE PASSED THROUGH HIS BRAIN AND ABRUPTLY JERKING THE RAINS
6081-41997-0016 I DID NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN CALLED THE OTHER MADAME AS LARGE AS LIFE WHILE THE OTHER SAID THEE AND THOU AND SPOKE AS IF SHE WERE SOMEBODY
6081-41997-0017 AND WHICH WAS IT THAT SAID THEE AND THOU

6081-41997-0020 SHE APPEARED TO BE SO ILL THAT I SAID TO MYSELF HERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS DRUNK MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR HER THESE FACTS CONFIRMED EVEN IF THEY CORRECTED
6081-41997-0021 LECOQ'S FIRST SUPPOSITIONS AS HE HAD SUSPECTED THE SOCIAL POSITION OF THE TWO WOMEN WAS NOT THE SAME HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN HOWEVER
6081-41997-0022 IN ATTRIBUTING THE HIGHER STANDING TO THE WOMAN WEARING THE SHOES WITH THE HIGH HEELS THE MARKS OF WHICH HE HAD SO PARTICULARLY NOTICED IN THE SNOW WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT SIGNS OF PRECIPITATION TERROR AND WEAKNESS
6081-41997-0023 IN REALITY SOCIAL PREEMINENCE BELONGED TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD LEFT THE LARGE BROAD FOOTPRINTS BEHIND HER AND NOT MERELY WAS SHE OF A SUPERIOR RANK BUT SHE HAD ALSO SHOWN SUPERIOR ENERGY
6081-41997-0024 CONTRARY TO LECOQ'S ORIGINAL IDEA IT NOW SEEMED EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS AND HER COMPANION THE SERVANT IS THAT ALL MY GOOD FELLOW HE ASKED THE DRIVER
6081-41997-0025 HAD A HAND AS SMALL AS A CHILD'S AND IN SPITE OF HER ANGER HER VOICE WAS AS SWEET AS MUSIC DID YOU SEE HER FACE I JUST CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF IT
6081-41997-0026 WHETHER SHE WAS A BLONDE OR BRUNETTE SO MANY QUESTIONS AT A TIME CONFUSED THE DRIVER STOP A MINUTE HE REPLIED IN MY OPINION SHE WASN'T PRETTY AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WAS YOUNG
6081-41997-0027 BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS A BLONDE AND WITH PLENTY OF HAIR TOO WAS SHE TALL OR SHORT STOUT OR SLENDER BETWEEN THE TWO THIS WAS VERY VAGUE AND THE OTHER
6081-41997-0028 ASKED LECOQ THE NEATLY DRESSED ONE THE DEUCE AS FOR HER I DID NOT NOTICE HER AT ALL ALL I KNOW ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE WAS VERY SMALL WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE HER IF YOU MET HER AGAIN GOOD HEAVENS NO
6081-41997-0029 THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ROLLING ALONG THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET THE DRIVER PULLED UP AND TURNING TO LECOQ EXCLAIMED HERE WE ARE THAT'S THE HOUSE THE HUSSIES WENT INTO
6081-41997-0030 TO DRAW OFF THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF THAT SERVED HIM AS A MUFFLER TO FOLD IT AND SLIP IT INTO HIS POCKET TO SPRING TO THE GROUND AND ENTER THE HOUSE INDICATED WAS ONLY THE WORK OF AN INSTANT FOR THE YOUNG DETECTIVE
6081-41997-0031 IN THE CONCIERGE'S LITTLE ROOM HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN KNITTING LECOQ BOWED TO HER POLITELY AND DISPLAYING THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF EXCLAIMED MADAME I HAVE COME TO RETURN THIS ARTICLE TO ONE OF YOUR LODGERS
6081-41997-0032 TO WHICH ONE REALLY I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW IN A MOMENT THE WORTHY DAME IMAGINED THAT THIS POLITE YOUNG MAN WAS MAKING FUN OF HER YOU SCAMP SHE BEGAN
6081-41997-0033 EXCUSE ME INTERRUPTED LECOQ ALLOW ME TO FINISH I MUST TELL YOU THAT AT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I WAS QUIETLY RETURNING HOME WHEN TWO LADIES WHO WERE SEEMINGLY IN A GREAT HURRY
6081-41997-0034 OVERTOOK ME AND PASSED ON ONE OF THEM DROPPED THIS HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I PICKED UP I HASTENED AFTER HER TO RESTORE IT BUT BEFORE I COULD OVERTAKE THEM THEY HAD RUNG THE BELL AT YOUR DOOR AND WERE ALREADY IN THE HOUSE
6081-41997-0035 FOR FEAR OF DISTURBING YOU YESTERDAY I WAS SO BUSY I COULDN'T COME HOWEVER HERE I AM AT LAST AND HERE'S THE HANDKERCHIEF SO SAYING
6081-41997-0036 I SLIPPED ON MY DRESS AND WENT OUT INTO THE HALL WHERE I SAW TWO WOMEN HASTENING TOWARD THE DOOR BEFORE I COULD REACH THEM THEY SLAMMED THE DOOR IN MY FACE I OPENED IT AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
6081-41997-0037 BUT THEY WERE HURRYING AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD IN WHAT DIRECTION OH THEY WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE RUE DE VARENNES
6081-41997-0038 HOWEVER HE BOWED CIVILLY TO THE CONCIERGE WHOM HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE NEED OF AT ANOTHER TIME AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE CAB AS I HAD SUPPOSED THEY DO NOT LIVE HERE HE REMARKED TO THE DRIVER
