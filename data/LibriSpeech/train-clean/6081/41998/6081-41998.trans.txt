6081-41998-0000 WHEN A MYSTERIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED OR A GREAT CATASTROPHE HAS HAPPENED AND THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED A GREAT DAY INVARIABLY FOLLOWS AT THE MORGUE
6081-41998-0001 THE ATTENDANTS ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE HORRORS OF THE PLACE THAT THE MOST SICKLY SIGHT FAILS TO IMPRESS THEM AND EVEN UNDER THE MOST DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HASTEN GAILY TO AND FRO
6081-41998-0002 EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
6081-41998-0003 AS THE VEHICLE CONVEYING LECOQ REACHED THE QUAY
6081-41998-0004 THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE TRAGEDY AT THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S DRINKING DEN OF COURSE MORE OR LESS CORRECTLY AND EVERYBODY WISHED TO SEE THE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0005 I PREFER TO ALIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF THE MORGUE HE SAID SPRINGING TO THE GROUND THEN PRODUCING FIRST HIS WATCH AND NEXT HIS PURSE HE ADDED
6081-41998-0006 WE HAVE BEEN AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES MY GOOD FELLOW CONSEQUENTLY I OWE YOU NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED THE DRIVER DECIDEDLY BUT NO NOT A SOU
6081-41998-0007 I AM TOO WORRIED ALREADY TO THINK THAT I TOOK THE MONEY THESE HUSSIES OFFERED ME IT WOULD ONLY HAVE SERVED ME RIGHT IF THE LIQUOR I BOUGHT WITH IT HAD GIVEN ME THE GRIPES DON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT THE SCORE AND IF YOU NEED A TRAP USE MINE FOR NOTHING
6081-41998-0008 TILL YOU HAVE CAUGHT THE JADES AS LECOQ'S PURSE WAS LOW HE DID NOT INSIST YOU WILL AT LEAST TAKE MY NAME AND ADDRESS CONTINUED THE DRIVER CERTAINLY
6081-41998-0009 THE MAGISTRATE WILL WANT YOUR EVIDENCE AND A SUMMONS WILL BE SENT YOU ALL RIGHT THEN ADDRESS IT TO PAPILLON EUGENE DRIVER
6081-41998-0010 I LODGE AT HIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SMALL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS YOU SEE THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN PAPILLON CALLED HIM BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MORGUE YOU WILL WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE SAID
6081-41998-0011 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND THAT YOU WERE ALREADY LATE YES I OUGHT TO BE AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE BUT IT IS ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM HERE NO MATTER
6081-41998-0012 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE IT'S USELESS TO SAY NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND I'M A BRETON YOU KNOW
6081-41998-0013 ACCORDINGLY LECOQ MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT AND THEN HURRIED TOWARD THE MORGUE IF THERE WAS A CROWD ON THE ROADWAY OUTSIDE IT WAS BECAUSE THE GLOOMY BUILDING ITSELF WAS CRAMMED FULL OF PEOPLE INDEED THE SIGHTSEERS
6081-41998-0014 MOST OF WHOM COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WERE PACKED AS CLOSELY AS SARDINES
6081-41998-0015 THAT LECOQ MANAGED TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AS USUAL HE FOUND AMONG THE MOB A LARGE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN FOR STRANGE TO SAY
6081-41998-0016 TO THE DISGUSTING SIGHTS AND HORRIBLE EMOTIONS THAT REPAY A VISIT TO THE MORGUE THE SHOP AND WORK GIRLS WHO RESIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD READILY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE CORPSES
6081-41998-0017 WHICH CRIME ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE BRING TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE A FEW
6081-41998-0018 MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
6081-41998-0019 IF ALL THE MARBLE SLABS ARE UNOCCUPIED STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE VISITORS TURN HASTILY AWAY WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISCONTENT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THEIR DOING SO HOWEVER
6081-41998-0020 FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERER WHOSE IDENTITY LECOQ WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH HAD FURNISHED THREE VICTIMS FOR THEIR DELECTATION
6081-41998-0021 AND YET A DAMP CHILL CAME FROM BEYOND THE IRON RAILINGS WHILE FROM THE CROWD ITSELF ROSE AN INFECTIOUS VAPOR IMPREGNATED WITH THE STENCH OF THE CHLORIDE OF LIME USED AS A DISINFECTANT
6081-41998-0022 AS A CONTINUOUS ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE EXCLAMATIONS SIGHS AND WHISPERED COMMENTS OF THE BYSTANDERS CAME THE MURMUR OF THE WATER TRICKLING FROM A SPIGOT AT THE HEAD OF EACH SLAB A TINY STREAM THAT FLOWED FORTH
6081-41998-0023 ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
6081-41998-0024 REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
6081-41998-0025 FOR NOTHING IS WASTED AT THE MORGUE HOWEVER LECOQ WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO REMARK THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE HE SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE ON THE THREE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0026 WHOM HE COULD NOT PERCEIVE HAD GEVROL INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY FAILED TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE
6081-41998-0027 UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS COMRADE'S ABSENCE LECOQ ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEAD KEEPER IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ONE HAS RECOGNIZED THE VICTIMS HE REMARKED NO ONE AND YET
6081-41998-0028 EVER SINCE OPENING WE HAVE HAD AN IMMENSE CROWD IF I WERE MASTER HERE ON DAYS LIKE THIS I WOULD CHARGE AN ADMISSION FEE OF TWO SOUS A HEAD
6081-41998-0029 IT WOULD BRING IN A ROUND SUM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSES THE KEEPER'S REPLY SEEMED TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO CONVERSATION BUT LECOQ DID NOT SEIZE IT
6081-41998-0030 BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE VENTURED TO INQUIRE ARE YOU ONE OF THEM YES I AM REPLIED LECOQ EXHIBITING HIS CARD IN SUPPORT OF HIS ASSERTION AND YOUR NAME
6081-41998-0031 THE KEEPER'S FACE BRIGHTENED UP IN THAT CASE SAID HE I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU WRITTEN BY YOUR COMRADE WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY HERE IT IS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE AT ONCE TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ
6081-41998-0032 MONSIEUR LECOQ MONSIEUR THIS SIMPLE FORMULA OF POLITENESS BROUGHT A FAINT SMILE TO HIS LIPS
6081-41998-0033 WHEN AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THREE YOUNG MEN ENTERED ARM IN ARM FROM THEIR MANNER AND APPEARANCE I JUDGED THEM TO BE CLERKS IN SOME STORE OR WAREHOUSE
6081-41998-0034 SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT AND CALLING THE ATTENTION OF HIS COMPANIONS TO ONE OF THE UNKNOWN VICTIMS HE WHISPERED GUSTAVE
6081-41998-0035 HIS COMRADES PUT THEIR HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT YOU FOOL TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THIS AFFAIR DO YOU WANT TO GET US INTO TROUBLE THEREUPON THEY WENT OUT AND I FOLLOWED THEM
6081-41998-0036 BUT THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN WAS SO OVERCOME THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAG HIMSELF ALONG AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE HIM TO A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE BY I ENTERED IT MYSELF AND IT IS THERE I WRITE THIS LETTER
6081-41998-0037 IN THE MEAN TIME WATCHING THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEND THIS NOTE EXPLAINING MY ABSENCE TO THE HEAD KEEPER WHO WILL GIVE IT YOU YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THESE MEN A B
6081-41998-0038 S THE HANDWRITING OF THIS LETTER WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THERE WERE MISTAKES IN SPELLING IN WELL NIGH EVERY LINE STILL ITS MEANING WAS CLEAR AND EXACT AND COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE MOST FLATTERING HOPES
6081-41998-0039 AS THE OLD COACHMAN URGED ON HIS HORSE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING THINGS ARE GOING ON TO SUIT YOU A FRIENDLY HUSH WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE
6081-41998-0040 WHO INSISTED UPON REMAINING AT HIS ORDERS HE SUCCEEDED AT LAST HOWEVER BUT EVEN WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE PORTICO ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
6081-41998-0041 LECOQ HAD ENTERED THE LEFT WING OF THE PALAIS HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TILL HE HAD REACHED THE THIRD FLOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE LONG NARROW BADLY LIGHTED CORRIDOR
6081-41998-0042 WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
6081-41998-0043 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SAID HE
