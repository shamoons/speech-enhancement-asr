6081-42010-0000 HE FIRST OF ALL PROCEEDED TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE GOING THE LONGEST WAY ROUND AS A MATTER OF COURSE BUT ON REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN THE YOUNG DETECTIVE ACCORDINGLY
6081-42010-0001 AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
6081-42010-0002 NUMEROUS GLASSES OF THE FAVORITE MORNING BEVERAGE WHITE WINE TURN WHICH WAY HE WOULD HOWEVER LOITER AS LONG AS HE MIGHT
6081-42010-0003 HE WAS RETURNING IN HASTE A TRIFLE UNEASY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF HIS ABSENCE WHEN HE PERCEIVED A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE PALAIS GATEWAY A SECOND GLANCE AND OH GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE SAW LECOQ
6081-42010-0004 FATHER ABSINTHE AND THE VIRTUOUS TOINON ALIGHT FROM THIS VERY VEHICLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AT ONCE RETURNED AND IT WAS IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT HUSKY TONE
6081-42010-0005 THAT HE DELIVERED THE ORDER FOR LECOQ TO FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY
6081-42010-0006 HAS ASKED FOR YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES SAID HE HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPATIENT AND HE IS IN A VERY BAD HUMOR SO YOU MAY EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD SNAPPED OFF IN THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MANNER LECOQ SMILED AS HE WENT UP THE STAIRS
6081-42010-0007 WAS HE NOT BRINGING WITH HIM THE MOST POTENT OF JUSTIFICATIONS HE THOUGHT OF THE AGREEABLE SURPRISE HE HAD IN STORE FOR THE MAGISTRATE AND FANCIED HE COULD PICTURE THE SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THAT FUNCTIONARY'S GLOOMY FACE
6081-42010-0008 AND YET FATE SO WILLED IT THAT THE DOORKEEPER'S MESSAGE AND HIS URGENT APPEAL THAT LECOQ SHOULD NOT LOITER ON THE WAY PRODUCED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE RESULTS
6081-42010-0009 WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
6081-42010-0010 HE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED HIS MISTAKE AND UNDERSTOOD ITS CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE HE MUST PREVENT ANY EXCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THE TWO
6081-42010-0011 HE ORDERED HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM AT ONCE BUT THE POOR CREATURE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER UNWORTHY HUSBAND AND THE HAPPINESS SHE FELT AT SEEING HIM AGAIN SHONE PLAINLY IN HER ANXIOUS GAZE
6081-42010-0012 JUST FOR ONE SECOND AND THEN SHE CAUGHT HIS WITHERING GLANCE AND HEARD HIS WORDS OF MENACE TERROR STRICKEN SHE STAGGERED BACK AND THEN LECOQ SEIZED HER AROUND THE WAIST
6081-42010-0013 AND LIFTING HER WITH HIS STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THE WHOLE SCENE HAD BEEN SO BRIEF
6081-42010-0014 WAS STILL FORMING THE ORDER FOR TOINON TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ROOM WHEN HE FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN
6081-42010-0015 AH AH THOUGHT THE SMILING CLERK IN A FLUTTER OF DELIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW BUT AS THESE LITTLE DIVERSIONS NEVER MADE HIM FORGET HIS DUTIES HE LEANED TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE AND ASKED
6081-42010-0016 AND WORD FOR WORD IF YOU PLEASE HE PAUSED THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN THIS TIME TO ADMIT THE MAGISTRATE'S MESSENGER WHO TIMIDLY AND WITH A RATHER GUILTY AIR
6081-42010-0017 AT THE SAME TIME CASTING THE BLAME ON HIS OWN IMPATIENCE AND LACK OF CAUTION
6081-42010-0018 YET OBTAINING THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED LET US PROCEED HE SAID TO POLYTE WHO HAD NOT MOVED SINCE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE ROOM
6081-42010-0019 BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
6081-42010-0020 WHY DID YOU BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER IT WASN'T THE TIME FOR SENTIMENT YOU ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH YOU SIMPLY DESIRED TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION TO INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I
6081-42010-0021 I INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU BUT FOR THAT SUPPOSITION YOUR WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MEANINGLESS WHAT WORDS THE MAGISTRATE TURNED TO HIS CLERK
6081-42010-0022 READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0023 WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND SIR
6081-42010-0024 DON'T PREVARICATE ANY LONGER HE SAID YOU CERTAINLY ORDERED YOUR WIFE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LACHENEUR THAT'S EVIDENT WHY DID YOU DO SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TELLING US
6081-42010-0025 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE POLICE ARE IGNORANT OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH LACHENEUR OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME IN A CAB TO THE CORNER OF THE WASTE GROUND NEAR YOUR MOTHER'S WINE SHOP AND OF THE HOPES OF FORTUNE YOU BASED UPON HIS PROMISES
6081-42010-0026 BE GUIDED BY ME CONFESS EVERYTHING WHILE THERE IS YET TIME AND ABANDON THE PRESENT COURSE WHICH MAY LEAD YOU INTO SERIOUS DANGER ONE MAY BE AN ACCOMPLICE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
6081-42010-0027 AS THESE WORDS FELL ON POLYTE'S EARS IT WAS EVIDENT HIS IMPUDENCE AND INDIFFERENCE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AND HUNG HIS HEAD AS IF THOROUGHLY ABASHED STILL HE PRESERVED AN OBSTINATE SILENCE
6081-42010-0028 AND THE MAGISTRATE FINDING THAT THIS LAST THRUST HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EFFECT GAVE UP THE FIGHT IN DESPAIR HE RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED THE GUARD TO CONDUCT THE WITNESS BACK TO PRISON
6081-42010-0029 AND TO TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION TO PREVENT HIM SEEING HIS WIFE AGAIN WHEN POLYTE HAD DEPARTED LECOQ REENTERED THE ROOM
6081-42010-0030 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME AND MADE HASTE TO BRING HER HERE I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST NEVER MIND THE MISFORTUNE CAN BE REPAIRED NO SIR NO SINCE SHE HAS SEEN HER HUSBAND
6081-42010-0031 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0032 AND SHE IS SO TERRIFIED THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF MAKING HER SPEAK
6081-42010-0033 AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
6081-42010-0034 POLYTE'S THREAT HAD AROUSED THE MOST SINISTER APPREHENSIONS IN HER MIND NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR SHE ASKED HERSELF IF HER TESTIMONY MIGHT NOT PROVE HIS DEATH WARRANT
6081-42010-0035 NO OR I DON'T KNOW AND RETRACTED EVERYTHING SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED TO LECOQ SHE SWORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD THAT HER WORDS HAD BEEN MISCONSTRUED
6081-42010-0036 AT LAST SHE BURST INTO WILD DESPAIRING SOBS AND PRESSED HER FRIGHTENED CHILD AGAINST HER BREAST WHAT COULD BE DONE TO OVERCOME THIS FOOLISH OBSTINACY AS BLIND AND UNREASONING AS A BRUTE'S
6081-42010-0037 BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR STRANGE SILENCE INJURES YOUR HUSBAND FAR MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY SHE LEFT THE ROOM OR RATHER SHE RUSHED WILDLY FROM IT AS THOUGH ONLY TOO EAGER TO ESCAPE
