6209-34599-0000 A BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS SINCE THE HOOKER HAD SAILED FROM THE CREEK OF PORTLAND LEAVING THE BOY ON THE SHORE
6209-34599-0001 DURING THE LONG HOURS SINCE HE HAD BEEN DESERTED AND HAD BEEN JOURNEYING ONWARDS HE HAD MET BUT THREE PERSONS OF THAT HUMAN SOCIETY INTO WHICH HE WAS PERCHANCE ABOUT TO ENTER A MAN THE MAN ON THE HILL
6209-34599-0002 A WOMAN THE WOMAN IN THE SNOW AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHOM HE WAS CARRYING IN HIS ARMS HE WAS EXHAUSTED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER YET ADVANCED MORE RESOLUTELY THAN EVER WITH LESS STRENGTH AND AN ADDED BURDEN
6209-34599-0003 THAT WHICH HE LOST WAS NOT THROWN AWAY BUT WAS GAINED BY HER HE FOUND OUT THAT THE POOR INFANT ENJOYED THE COMFORT WHICH WAS TO HER THE RENEWAL OF LIFE HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
6209-34599-0004 FROM TIME TO TIME STILL HOLDING HER SECURELY HE BENT DOWN AND TAKING A HANDFUL OF SNOW HE RUBBED HIS FEET WITH IT TO PREVENT THEIR BEING FROST BITTEN
6209-34599-0005 HE PUT A LITTLE SNOW IN HIS MOUTH AND SUCKED IT THIS FOR A MOMENT ASSUAGED HIS THIRST BUT CHANGED IT INTO FEVER A RELIEF WHICH WAS AN AGGRAVATION THE STORM HAD BECOME SHAPELESS FROM ITS VIOLENCE
6209-34599-0006 DELUGES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE THIS WAS ONE
6209-34599-0007 THIS WAS PERHAPS THE MOMENT WHEN THE DISTRACTED HOOKER WAS GOING TO PIECES IN THE BATTLE OF THE BREAKERS HE TRAVELLED UNDER THIS NORTH WIND STILL TOWARDS THE EAST OVER WIDE SURFACES OF SNOW HE KNEW NOT HOW THE HOURS HAD PASSED
6209-34599-0008 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
6209-34599-0009 DOUBTING HE YET PERSEVERED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE LITTLE INFANT CRIED THEN HE ADOPTED IN HIS GAIT A ROCKING MOVEMENT AND THE CHILD WAS SOOTHED AND SILENCED
6209-34599-0010 SHE ENDED BY FALLING INTO A SOUND SLEEP SHIVERING HIMSELF HE FELT HER WARM
6209-34599-0011 SO THAT THE FROST SHOULD NOT GET IN THROUGH ANY OPENING AND THAT NO MELTED SNOW SHOULD DROP BETWEEN THE GARMENT AND THE CHILD THE PLAIN WAS UNEQUAL IN THE DECLIVITIES INTO WHICH IT SLOPED THE SNOW
6209-34599-0012 DRIVEN BY THE WIND INTO THE DIPS OF THE GROUND WAS SO DEEP IN COMPARISON WITH A CHILD SO SMALL THAT IT ALMOST ENGULFED HIM AND HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT HALF BURIED HE WALKED ON WORKING AWAY THE SNOW WITH HIS KNEES
6209-34599-0013 PLAYING ON HIS FACE WARMED IT FOR A MOMENT THEN LINGERED AND FROZE IN HIS HAIR STIFFENING IT INTO ICICLES HE FELT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER DANGER HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO FALL
6209-34599-0014 HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
6209-34599-0015 HE HAD TRIPPED UPON THE SLOPES OF PRECIPICES AND HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF
6209-34599-0016 THENCEFORWARD THE SLIGHTEST FALL WOULD BE DEATH A FALSE STEP OPENED FOR HIM A TOMB HE MUST NOT SLIP HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO RISE EVEN TO HIS KNEES NOW EVERYTHING WAS SLIPPERY
6209-34599-0017 EVERYWHERE THERE WAS RIME AND FROZEN SNOW THE LITTLE CREATURE WHOM HE CARRIED MADE HIS PROGRESS FEARFULLY DIFFICULT SHE WAS NOT ONLY A BURDEN WHICH HIS WEARINESS AND EXHAUSTION MADE EXCESSIVE BUT WAS ALSO AN EMBARRASSMENT
6209-34599-0018 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0019 BENDING UNDER HIS BURDEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM THIS LITTLE INFANT WAS THE DROP CAUSING THE CUP OF DISTRESS TO OVERFLOW HE ADVANCED REELING AT EVERY STEP AS IF ON A SPRING BOARD
6209-34599-0020 AND ACCOMPLISHING WITHOUT SPECTATORS MIRACLES OF EQUILIBRIUM LET US REPEAT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS FOLLOWED ON THIS PATH OF PAIN BY EYES UNSLEEPING IN THE DISTANCES OF THE SHADOWS THE EYES OF THE MOTHER AND THE EYES OF GOD
6209-34599-0021 HE STAGGERED SLIPPED RECOVERED HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF THE INFANT AND GATHERING THE JACKET ABOUT HER HE COVERED UP HER HEAD STAGGERED AGAIN ADVANCED SLIPPED THEN DREW HIMSELF UP THE COWARDLY WIND DROVE AGAINST HIM
6209-34599-0022 APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
6209-34599-0023 HOMESTEADS AND COTTAGES OCCUPY THE PLACE OF WASTE LANDS SOMETIMES LESS THAN A CENTURY SEPARATES A STEPPE FROM A CITY SUDDENLY A LULL HAVING OCCURRED IN THE ICY BLAST WHICH WAS BLINDING HIM
6209-34599-0024 HE PERCEIVED AT A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM A CLUSTER OF GABLES AND OF CHIMNEYS SHOWN IN RELIEF BY THE SNOW THE REVERSE OF A SILHOUETTE A CITY PAINTED IN WHITE ON A BLACK HORIZON
6209-34599-0025 SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE CALL NOWADAYS A NEGATIVE PROOF ROOFS DWELLINGS SHELTER HE HAD ARRIVED SOMEWHERE AT LAST HE FELT THE INEFFABLE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOPE
6209-34599-0026 THE WATCH OF A SHIP WHICH HAS WANDERED FROM HER COURSE FEELS SOME SUCH EMOTION WHEN HE CRIES LAND HO HE HURRIED HIS STEPS AT LENGTH THEN HE WAS NEAR MANKIND
6209-34599-0027 THERE GLOWED WITHIN HIM THAT SUDDEN WARMTH SECURITY THAT OUT OF WHICH HE WAS EMERGING WAS OVER THENCEFORWARD THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE NIGHT NOR WINTER NOR TEMPEST
6209-34599-0028 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LEFT ALL EVIL CHANCES BEHIND HIM
6209-34599-0029 HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
6209-34599-0030 THERE WERE THE CHIMNEYS OF WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE NO SMOKE AROSE FROM THEM NOW HE WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE HOUSES HE CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN AN OPEN STREET
6209-34599-0031 AT THAT PERIOD BARS TO STREETS WERE FALLING INTO DISUSE THE STREET BEGAN BY TWO HOUSES IN THOSE TWO HOUSES NEITHER CANDLE NOR LAMP WAS TO BE SEEN NOR IN THE WHOLE STREET NOR IN THE WHOLE TOWN
6209-34599-0032 SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
6209-34599-0033 A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
6209-34599-0034 AN INHABITED PIG STY TOLD THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO INHABITED THE HOUSE ON THE LEFT WAS LARGE HIGH BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE WITH A SLATED ROOF
6209-34599-0035 OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
6209-34599-0036 NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
6209-34599-0037 BUT LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD NO VOICE WAS HEARD NO STEP MOVED NO CANDLE WAS LIGHTED HE SAW THAT THERE AS WELL THEY DID NOT CARE TO AWAKE
6209-34599-0038 THE HOUSE OF STONE AND THE THATCHED HOVEL WERE EQUALLY DEAF TO THE WRETCHED THE BOY DECIDED ON PUSHING ON FURTHER
