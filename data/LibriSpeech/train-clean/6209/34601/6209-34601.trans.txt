6209-34601-0000 MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
6209-34601-0001 TO THOSE TO WHOM SILENCE HAS BECOME DREADFUL A HOWL IS COMFORTING THAT FIERCE GROWL REASSURED HIM THAT THREAT WAS A PROMISE THERE WAS THERE A BEING ALIVE AND AWAKE
6209-34601-0002 MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
6209-34601-0003 FROM THE ROOF AROSE A FUNNEL AND OUT OF THE FUNNEL SMOKE THIS SMOKE WAS RED AND SEEMED TO IMPLY A GOOD FIRE IN THE INTERIOR BEHIND PROJECTING HINGES INDICATED A DOOR
6209-34601-0004 AND IN THE CENTRE OF THIS DOOR A SQUARE OPENING SHOWED A LIGHT INSIDE THE CARAVAN HE APPROACHED
6209-34601-0005 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6209-34601-0006 THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
6209-34601-0007 I AM WEARY SAID THE CHILD WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT I AM COLD WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE I AM HUNGRY THE HEAD REPLIED
6209-34601-0008 THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
6209-34601-0009 THE CHILD TURNED BACK
6209-34601-0010 RESUMED THE VOICE WHO HAS SENT ME A FELLOW LIKE THIS WHO IS HUNGRY AND COLD AND WHO DOES NOT COME IN THE CHILD AT ONCE REPULSED AND INVITED REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE VOICE CONTINUED
6209-34601-0011 YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
6209-34601-0012 CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
6209-34601-0013 SO BENUMBED ROLLED UP AND ENVELOPED IN THE JACKET THAT NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HER AND SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE SHAPELESS MASS HE PASSED OVER THE THREE STEPS AND HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD STOPPED
6209-34601-0014 NO CANDLE WAS BURNING IN THE CARAVAN PROBABLY FROM THE ECONOMY OF WANT THE HUT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A RED TINGE ARISING FROM THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STOVE IN WHICH SPARKLED A PEAT FIRE
6209-34601-0015 ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
6209-34601-0016 BESIDES TO THE PARTITION WERE ATTACHED SOME BOARDS ON BRACKETS AND SOME HOOKS FROM WHICH HUNG A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE BOARDS AND NAILS WERE ROWS OF GLASSES COPPERS AN ALEMBIC
6209-34601-0017 A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
6209-34601-0018 THE STOVE BEING IN FRONT IT WAS NOT EVEN A LITTLE ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY A BIG BOX THERE WAS MORE LIGHT OUTSIDE FROM THE SNOW THAN INSIDE FROM THE STOVE EVERYTHING IN THE CARAVAN WAS INDISTINCT AND MISTY
6209-34601-0019 NEVERTHELESS A REFLECTION OF THE FIRE ON THE CEILING ENABLED THE SPECTATOR TO READ IN LARGE LETTERS URSUS PHILOSOPHER THE CHILD IN FACT WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE OF HOMO AND URSUS
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD

6209-34601-0023 AND WITH FEVERISH HASTE HE DRAGGED OFF THE BOY'S RAGS WHICH TORE INTO SHREDS WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK DOWN FROM A NAIL A MAN'S SHIRT AND ONE OF THOSE KNITTED JACKETS WHICH ARE UP TO THIS DAY CALLED KISS ME QUICKS HERE ARE CLOTHES
6209-34601-0024 AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
6209-34601-0025 AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
6209-34601-0026 WHAT THE CHILD SAW IN THE PORRINGER WAS AGAIN HEAVEN TO HIM NAMELY A POTATO AND A BIT OF BACON YOU ARE HUNGRY
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
