625-132112-0000 THIS WAS INDEED THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY THE RICH GRANARY WHENCE POTATOES AND CORN AND COTTON POURED OUT TO THE FAMISHED AND RAGGED CONFEDERATE TROOPS AS THEY BATTLED FOR A CAUSE LOST LONG BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
625-132112-0001 SHELTERED AND SECURE IT BECAME THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR FAMILIES WEALTH AND SLAVES YET EVEN THEN THE HARD RUTHLESS RAPE OF THE LAND BEGAN TO TELL THE RED CLAY SUB SOIL ALREADY HAD BEGUN TO PEER ABOVE THE LOAM
625-132112-0002 THE HARDER THE SLAVES WERE DRIVEN THE MORE CARELESS AND FATAL WAS THEIR FARMING THEN CAME THE REVOLUTION OF WAR AND EMANCIPATION THE BEWILDERMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION AND NOW WHAT IS THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY
625-132112-0003 AND YONDER IN THE FIELD IS HER DARK YOUNG HUSBAND HOEING TO SUPPORT HER AT THIRTY CENTS A DAY WITHOUT BOARD ACROSS THE WAY IS GATESBY BROWN AND TALL LORD OF TWO THOUSAND ACRES SHREWDLY WON AND HELD
625-132112-0004 THERE IS A STORE CONDUCTED BY HIS BLACK SON
625-132112-0005 FIVE MILES BELOW HERE IS A TOWN OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY ONE WHITE NEW ENGLANDER HE OWNS ALMOST A RHODE ISLAND COUNTY WITH THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND HUNDREDS OF BLACK LABORERS
625-132112-0006 THEIR CABINS LOOK BETTER THAN MOST AND THE FARM WITH MACHINERY AND FERTILIZERS IS MUCH MORE BUSINESS LIKE THAN ANY IN THE COUNTY ALTHOUGH THE MANAGER DRIVES HARD BARGAINS IN WAGES WHEN NOW WE TURN AND LOOK FIVE MILES ABOVE
625-132112-0007 THERE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ARE FIVE HOUSES OF PROSTITUTES TWO OF BLACKS AND THREE OF WHITES AND IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OF THE WHITES A WORTHLESS BLACK BOY WAS HARBORED TOO OPENLY TWO YEARS AGO SO HE WAS HANGED FOR RAPE
625-132112-0008 AND HERE TOO IS THE HIGH WHITEWASHED FENCE OF THE STOCKADE AS THE COUNTY PRISON IS CALLED THE WHITE FOLKS SAY IT IS EVER FULL OF BLACK CRIMINALS THE BLACK FOLKS SAY THAT ONLY COLORED BOYS ARE SENT TO JAIL
625-132112-0009 AND THEY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GUILTY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE NEEDS CRIMINALS TO EKE OUT ITS INCOME BY THEIR FORCED LABOR IMMIGRANTS ARE HEIRS OF THE SLAVE BARON IN DOUGHERTY AND AS WE RIDE WESTWARD BY WIDE STRETCHING CORNFIELDS AND STUBBY ORCHARDS OF PEACH AND PEAR
625-132112-0010 WE SEE ON ALL SIDES WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF DARK FOREST A LAND OF CANAAN HERE AND THERE ARE TALES OF PROJECTS FOR MONEY GETTING BORN IN THE SWIFT DAYS OF RECONSTRUCTION
625-132112-0011 IMPROVEMENT COMPANIES WINE COMPANIES MILLS AND FACTORIES MOST FAILED AND FOREIGNERS FELL HEIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL LAND THIS DOUGHERTY WEST OF THE FLINT THE FORESTS ARE WONDERFUL
625-132112-0012 THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS
625-132112-0013 THE PLANTERS ARE IN DEBT TO THE MERCHANTS THE TENANTS OWE THE PLANTERS AND LABORERS BOW AND BEND BENEATH THE BURDEN OF IT ALL HERE AND THERE A MAN HAS RAISED HIS HEAD ABOVE THESE MURKY WATERS
625-132112-0014 WE PASSED ONE FENCED STOCK FARM WITH GRASS AND GRAZING CATTLE THAT LOOKED VERY HOME LIKE AFTER ENDLESS CORN AND COTTON HERE AND THERE ARE BLACK FREE HOLDERS THERE IS THE GAUNT DULL BLACK JACKSON WITH HIS HUNDRED ACRES
625-132112-0015 I SAYS LOOK UP IF YOU DON'T LOOK UP YOU CAN'T GET UP REMARKS JACKSON PHILOSOPHICALLY AND HE'S GOTTEN UP DARK CARTER'S NEAT BARNS WOULD DO CREDIT TO NEW ENGLAND HIS MASTER HELPED HIM TO GET A START
625-132112-0016 BUT WHEN THE BLACK MAN DIED LAST FALL THE MASTER'S SONS IMMEDIATELY LAID CLAIM TO THE ESTATE AND THEM WHITE FOLKS WILL GET IT TOO SAID MY YELLOW GOSSIP I TURN FROM THESE WELL TENDED ACRES WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE NEGRO IS RISING
625-132112-0017 EVEN THEN HOWEVER THE FIELDS AS WE PROCEED BEGIN TO REDDEN AND THE TREES DISAPPEAR ROWS OF OLD CABINS APPEAR FILLED WITH RENTERS AND LABORERS CHEERLESS BARE AND DIRTY FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH HERE AND THERE
625-132112-0018 SO HE MOVED HERE WHERE THE RENT IS HIGHER THE LAND POORER AND THE OWNER INFLEXIBLE HE RENTS A FORTY DOLLAR MULE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR POOR LAD A SLAVE AT TWENTY TWO THIS PLANTATION OWNED NOW BY A FOREIGNER
625-132112-0019 WAS A PART OF THE FAMOUS BOLTON ESTATE AFTER THE WAR IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS WORKED BY GANGS OF NEGRO CONVICTS AND BLACK CONVICTS THEN WERE EVEN MORE PLENTIFUL THAN NOW IT WAS A WAY OF MAKING NEGROES WORK AND THE QUESTION OF GUILT WAS A MINOR ONE
625-132112-0020 HARD TALES OF CRUELTY AND MISTREATMENT OF THE CHAINED FREEMEN ARE TOLD BUT THE COUNTY AUTHORITIES WERE DEAF UNTIL THE FREE LABOR MARKET WAS NEARLY RUINED BY WHOLESALE MIGRATION THEN THEY TOOK THE CONVICTS FROM THE PLANTATIONS
625-132112-0021 BUT NOT UNTIL ONE OF THE FAIREST REGIONS OF THE OAKEY WOODS HAD BEEN RUINED AND RAVISHED INTO A RED WASTE OUT OF WHICH ONLY A YANKEE OR AN IMMIGRANT COULD SQUEEZE MORE BLOOD FROM DEBT CURSED TENANTS NO WONDER THAT LUKE BLACK
625-132112-0022 SLOW DULL AND DISCOURAGED SHUFFLES TO OUR CARRIAGE AND TALKS HOPELESSLY WHY SHOULD HE STRIVE EVERY YEAR FINDS HIM DEEPER IN DEBT HOW STRANGE THAT GEORGIA THE WORLD HERALDED REFUGE OF POOR DEBTORS
625-132112-0023 SHOULD BIND HER OWN TO SLOTH AND MISFORTUNE AS RUTHLESSLY AS EVER ENGLAND DID THE POOR LAND GROANS WITH ITS BIRTH PAINS AND BRINGS FORTH SCARCELY A HUNDRED POUNDS OF COTTON TO THE ACRE WHERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
625-132112-0024 TWENTY YEARS YONDER SUNKEN CHEEKED OLD BLACK MAN HAS LABORED UNDER THAT SYSTEM AND NOW TURNED DAY LABORER IS SUPPORTING HIS WIFE AND BOARDING HIMSELF ON HIS WAGES OF A DOLLAR AND A HALF A WEEK RECEIVED ONLY PART OF THE YEAR
625-132112-0025 THE BOLTON CONVICT FARM FORMERLY INCLUDED THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATION HERE IT WAS THAT THE CONVICTS WERE LODGED IN THE GREAT LOG PRISON STILL STANDING A DISMAL PLACE IT STILL REMAINS WITH ROWS OF UGLY HUTS
625-132112-0026 UNSHADED WITH NO CHARM OF PAST ASSOCIATION ONLY A MEMORY OF FORCED HUMAN TOIL NOW THEN AND BEFORE THE WAR THEY ARE NOT HAPPY THESE BLACK MEN WHOM WE MEET THROUGHOUT THIS REGION
625-132112-0027 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE JOYOUS ABANDON AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLANTATION NEGRO AT BEST THE NATURAL GOOD NATURE IS EDGED WITH COMPLAINT OR HAS CHANGED INTO SULLENNESS AND GLOOM
625-132112-0028 AND STILL HAVING NOTHING TO BE SURE HE HAD GIVEN FOUR CHILDREN A COMMON SCHOOL TRAINING AND PERHAPS IF THE NEW FENCE LAW HAD NOT ALLOWED UNFENCED CROPS IN WEST DOUGHERTY HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED A LITTLE STOCK AND KEPT AHEAD
625-132112-0029 AS IT IS HE IS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT DISAPPOINTED AND EMBITTERED HE STOPPED US TO INQUIRE AFTER THE BLACK BOY IN ALBANY WHOM IT WAS SAID A POLICEMAN HAD SHOT AND KILLED FOR LOUD TALKING ON THE SIDEWALK
625-132112-0030 AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY LET A WHITE MAN TOUCH ME AND HE DIES I DON'T BOAST THIS I DON'T SAY IT AROUND LOUD OR BEFORE THE CHILDREN BUT I MEAN IT
625-132112-0031 AND WE PASSED ON NOW SEARS
625-132112-0032 HAPPY WELL YES HE LAUGHED AND FLIPPED PEBBLES AND THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS AS IT WAS HE HAD WORKED HERE TWELVE YEARS AND HAS NOTHING BUT A MORTGAGED MULE CHILDREN YES SEVEN BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR
625-132112-0033 COULDN'T AFFORD BOOKS AND CLOTHES AND COULDN'T SPARE THEIR WORK THERE GO PART OF THEM TO THE FIELDS NOW THREE BIG BOYS ASTRIDE MULES AND A STRAPPING GIRL WITH BARE BROWN LEGS
625-132112-0034 HERE AND THERE WE MEET DISTINCT CHARACTERS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY ONE CAME OUT OF A PIECE OF NEWLY CLEARED GROUND MAKING A WIDE DETOUR TO AVOID THE SNAKES HE WAS AN OLD HOLLOW CHEEKED MAN WITH A DRAWN
625-132112-0035 MADE NOTHING FOR TWO YEARS BUT I RECKON I'VE GOT A CROP NOW THE COTTON LOOKED TALL AND RICH AND WE PRAISED IT HE CURTSIED LOW AND THEN BOWED ALMOST TO THE GROUND
625-132112-0036 WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY THAT SEEMED ALMOST SUSPICIOUS THEN HE CONTINUED MY MULE DIED LAST WEEK A CALAMITY IN THIS LAND EQUAL TO A DEVASTATING FIRE IN TOWN
625-132112-0037 BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
625-132112-0038 THE WHISTLE PLACE WHICH INCLUDES HIS BIT OF LAND WAS BOUGHT SOON AFTER THE WAR BY AN ENGLISH SYNDICATE THE DIXIE COTTON AND CORN COMPANY A MARVELLOUS DEAL OF STYLE THEIR FACTOR PUT ON WITH HIS SERVANTS AND COACH AND SIX SO MUCH SO
625-132112-0039 THAT THE CONCERN SOON LANDED IN INEXTRICABLE BANKRUPTCY NOBODY LIVES IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW BUT A MAN COMES EACH WINTER OUT OF THE NORTH AND COLLECTS HIS HIGH RENTS I KNOW NOT WHICH ARE THE MORE TOUCHING SUCH OLD EMPTY HOUSES
625-132112-0040 OR THE HOMES OF THE MASTERS SONS SAD AND BITTER TALES LIE HIDDEN BACK OF THOSE WHITE DOORS TALES OF POVERTY OF STRUGGLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT A REVOLUTION SUCH AS THAT OF SIXTY THREE IS A TERRIBLE THING
625-132112-0041 FOR MONEY MONEY WHERE WAS IT TO COME FROM AND SO THE SON ROSE IN THE NIGHT AND KILLED HIS BABY AND KILLED HIS WIFE AND SHOT HIMSELF DEAD AND THE WORLD PASSED ON
625-132112-0042 I REMEMBER WHEELING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD BESIDE A GRACEFUL BIT OF FOREST AND A SINGING BROOK A LONG LOW HOUSE FACED US WITH PORCH AND FLYING PILLARS GREAT OAKEN DOOR AND A BROAD LAWN SHINING IN THE EVENING SUN
625-132112-0043 BUT THE WINDOW PANES WERE GONE THE PILLARS WERE WORM EATEN AND THE MOSS GROWN ROOF WAS FALLING IN HALF CURIOUSLY I PEERED THROUGH THE UNHINGED DOOR AND SAW WHERE ON THE WALL ACROSS THE HALL
625-132112-0044 WELCOME QUITE A CONTRAST TO THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF DOUGHERTY COUNTY IS THE NORTHWEST SOBERLY TIMBERED IN OAK AND PINE IT HAS NONE OF THAT HALF TROPICAL LUXURIANCE OF THE SOUTHWEST
625-132112-0045 THEN TOO THERE ARE FEWER SIGNS OF A ROMANTIC PAST AND MORE OF SYSTEMATIC MODERN LAND GRABBING AND MONEY GETTING WHITE PEOPLE ARE MORE IN EVIDENCE HERE
625-132112-0046 AND THERE WERE FENCES AND MEADOWS HERE AND THERE MOST OF THIS LAND WAS POOR AND BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE SLAVE BARON BEFORE THE WAR SINCE THEN HIS POOR RELATIONS AND FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS HAVE SEIZED IT
625-132112-0047 THE RETURNS OF THE FARMER ARE TOO SMALL TO ALLOW MUCH FOR WAGES AND YET HE WILL NOT SELL OFF SMALL FARMS THERE IS THE NEGRO SANFORD HE HAS WORKED FOURTEEN YEARS AS OVERSEER ON THE LADSON PLACE AND
625-132112-0048 BUT THE OWNER WILL NOT SELL OFF A FEW ACRES TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL ARE HOEING STURDILY IN THE FIELDS ON THE FARM WHERE CORLISS WORKS HE IS SMOOTH FACED AND BROWN AND IS FENCING UP HIS PIGS
625-132112-0049 FOR PA WILLIS WAS THE TALL AND POWERFUL BLACK MOSES WHO LED THE NEGROES FOR A GENERATION AND LED THEM WELL HE WAS A BAPTIST PREACHER AND WHEN HE DIED TWO THOUSAND BLACK PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE GRAVE AND NOW THEY PREACH HIS FUNERAL SERMON EACH YEAR
625-132112-0050 A WEAZENED SHARP FEATURED LITTLE WOMAN WHO CURTSIED QUAINTLY AS WE GREETED HER FURTHER ON LIVES JACK DELSON THE MOST PROSPEROUS NEGRO FARMER IN THE COUNTY IT IS A JOY TO MEET HIM
625-132112-0051 A GREAT BROAD SHOULDERED HANDSOME BLACK MAN INTELLIGENT AND JOVIAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES HE OWNS AND HAS ELEVEN BLACK TENANTS A NEAT AND TIDY HOME NESTLED IN A FLOWER GARDEN AND A LITTLE STORE STANDS BESIDE IT
625-132112-0052 WE PASS THE MUNSON PLACE WHERE A PLUCKY WHITE WIDOW IS RENTING AND STRUGGLING AND THE ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THE SENNET PLANTATION WITH ITS NEGRO OVERSEER
625-132112-0053 THEN THE CHARACTER OF THE FARMS BEGINS TO CHANGE
625-132112-0054 THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE
625-132112-0055 AND FEW HAVE TIME TO TALK TIRED WITH THE LONG RIDE WE GLADLY DRIVE INTO GILLONSVILLE IT IS A SILENT CLUSTER OF FARMHOUSES STANDING ON THE CROSSROADS WITH ONE OF ITS STORES CLOSED AND THE OTHER KEPT BY A NEGRO PREACHER
625-132112-0056 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCENES ONE CANNOT SOON FORGET A WIDE LOW LITTLE HOUSE WHOSE MOTHERLY ROOF REACHED OVER AND SHELTERED A SNUG LITTLE PORCH THERE WE SAT AFTER THE LONG HOT DRIVE DRINKING COOL WATER
625-132112-0057 THE TALKATIVE LITTLE STOREKEEPER WHO IS MY DAILY COMPANION THE SILENT OLD BLACK WOMAN PATCHING PANTALOONS AND SAYING NEVER A WORD THE RAGGED PICTURE OF HELPLESS MISFORTUNE WHO CALLED IN JUST TO SEE THE PREACHER AND FINALLY THE NEAT
625-132112-0058 MATRONLY PREACHER'S WIFE PLUMP YELLOW AND INTELLIGENT OWN LAND SAID THE WIFE WELL ONLY THIS HOUSE THEN SHE ADDED QUIETLY WE DID BUY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES ACROSS UP YONDER AND PAID FOR IT BUT THEY CHEATED US OUT OF IT
