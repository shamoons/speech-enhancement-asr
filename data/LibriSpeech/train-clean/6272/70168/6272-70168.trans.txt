6272-70168-0000 INSTEAD OF MY HEART LEAPING FOR JOY AS I HAD EXPECTED A SUDDEN INDIFFERENCE FILLED IT I FELT AVERSE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NARROW WAYS OF BARMOUTH WHICH FOR THE MOMENT I REGRETTED
6272-70168-0001 WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAW MOTHER IN HER OLD PLACE HER SURROUNDINGS UNALTERED I SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFERRING THE ATMOSPHERE OF MY YEAR'S MISERY TO SURREY
6272-70168-0002 I HEARD THE WONTED SOUND OF THE BANGING OF DOORS THE DOORS AT GRAND'THER'S I MUSED HAD LIST NAILED ROUND THEIR EDGES BUT THEN HE HAD THE LIST BEING A TAILOR I VUM SAID TEMPERANCE WITH HER HAND ON HER HIP
6272-70168-0003 AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
6272-70168-0004 IS IT BEST TO COOK MORE MISSUS MORGESON
6272-70168-0005 THE BOY BY NAME CHARLES CAME TO SEE THE NEW ARRIVAL BUT SMITTEN WITH DIFFIDENCE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AND EXAMINED ME FROM HIS RETREAT
6272-70168-0006 INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
6272-70168-0007 SAID TEMPERANCE CALL HER WHEN SUPPER IS READY REPLIED MOTHER WHO ASKED ME TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM WHERE ARTHUR WAS SLEEPING HE WAS A HANDSOME CHILD LARGE AND FAIR AND AS I LIFTED HIS WHITE LAX FINGERS
6272-70168-0008 A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
6272-70168-0009 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SHADOW OF A CHANGE DURING THE REVIVAL AT BARMOUTH NO MORE THAN THE BABY HERE DID I SHALL HAVE FAITH THOUGH
6272-70168-0010 BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE BLESSING OF SO GOOD A MAN AS YOUR GRAND'THER BUT I NEVER HEARD A WORD OF GRAND'THER'S PRAYERS DO YOU REMEMBER HIS VOICE
6272-70168-0011 MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
6272-70168-0012 TEMPERANCE BROUGHT ARTHUR TO THE TABLE HALF ASLEEP BUT HE ROUSED WHEN SHE DRUMMED ON HIS PLATE WITH A SPOON HEPSEY WAS STATIONED BY THE BANNOCK KNIFE IN HAND TO SERVE IT AS WE BEGAN OUR MEAL
6272-70168-0013 VERONICA CAME IN FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A PLATE OF TOASTED CRACKERS SHE SET THE PLATE DOWN AND GRAVELY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME SAYING SHE HAD CONCLUDED TO LIVE ENTIRELY ON TOAST BUT SUPPOSED I WOULD EAT ALL SORTS OF FOOD AS USUAL
6272-70168-0014 HER FACE WAS STILL LONG AND NARROW BUT PRETTIER AND HER LARGE DARK EYES HAD A SLIGHT CAST WHICH GAVE HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION DISTANT INDIFFERENT AND SPECULATIVE AS THE EYES WERE
6272-70168-0015 AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
6272-70168-0016 SHE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION TO FULFILL HER DUTIES THAT WAY
6272-70168-0017 I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
6272-70168-0018 PRESENTLY TEMPERANCE CAME IN WITH CHARLES BRINGING FRESH PLATES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER VERONICA ASKED TEMPERANCE HOW THE FISH TASTED IS IT SALT MIDDLING HOW IS THE BANNOCK EXCELLENT
6272-70168-0019 THE GLUTTON BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE LONG THEY ARE ALL SO WHEN THEY FIRST COME SHE THEN GAVE HIM A LARGE SLICE OF THE CAKE VERONICA CONTRARY TO HER WONT
6272-70168-0020 I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
6272-70168-0021 SAY SO TO MY OWN CHILD VERRY TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SAID NO MORE BUT SHE HAD STARTED A LESS PLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IT WAS CHANGED AGAIN BY TEMPERANCE COMING WITH LIGHTS
6272-70168-0022 THOUGH THE TALL BRASS LAMPS GLITTERED LIKE GOLD THEIR CIRCLE OF LIGHT WAS SMALL THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WERE OBSCURE MISTER PARK ENTERING RETREATED INTO ONE AND MOTHER WAS OBLIGED TO FOREGO THE PLEASURE OF UNDRESSING ARTHUR
6272-70168-0023 SO SHE SENT HIM OFF WITH TEMPERANCE AND CHARLES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO ROCK THE CRADLE AS LONG AS HIS BABYSHIP REQUIRED SOON AFTER FATHER CAME AND HEPSEY BROUGHT IN HIS HOT SUPPER WHILE HE WAS EATING IT GRANDFATHER JOHN MORGESON BUSTLED IN
6272-70168-0024 AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME I SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD WHITENED HE HELD A TASSELED CANE BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THUMPED THE FLOOR WHENEVER HE ASKED A QUESTION
6272-70168-0025 AND MOTHER LISTENED WITH A VAGUE RESPECTFUL ATTENTION HER HAND WAS PRESSED AGAINST HER BREAST AS IF SHE WERE REPRESSING AN INWARD VOICE WHICH CLAIMED HER ATTENTION
6272-70168-0026 HER HAIR DROPPED ON HER SHOULDER AND LOOKED LIKE A BROWN COILED SERPENT VERONICA WHO HAD BEEN SILENTLY OBSERVING HER ROSE FROM THE SOFA PICKED UP THE COMB AND FASTENED HER HAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING AS SHE PASSED SHE GAVE ME A DARK LOOK
6272-70168-0027 EH VERRY SAID FATHER ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU GLAD TO SEE CASSY HOME AGAIN SHOULD I BE GLAD WHAT CAN SHE DO GRANDFATHER PURSED UP HIS MOUTH
6272-70168-0028 AND TURNED TOWARD MOTHER AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU UNDERSTAND BRINGING UP CHILDREN DON'T YOU SHE COMPREHENDED HIM AND GIVING HER HEAD A SLIGHT TOSS TOLD VERRY TO GO AND PLAY ON THE PIANO I WAS GOING SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
6272-70168-0029 AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
6272-70168-0030 JOE BACON MOTHER RETIRED VERRY STILL PLAYED HER TALENT IS WONDERFUL SAID FATHER TAKING THE CIGAR FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE WAY YOU MUST TAKE LESSONS IN MILFORD I WISH YOU WOULD LEARN TO SING
6272-70168-0031 THOUGH THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT THE LAMPS WINKED BRIGHTLY AND FATHER MOVING HIS CIGAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CHANGED HIS REGARDS FROM ONE LAMP TO THE OTHER AND SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS GROWING TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL
6272-70168-0032 A VERY STRONG RELATION OF RESERVE GENERALLY EXISTED BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL ONE AND THE CHILD WAS APT TO DISCOVER THAT RESERVE ON THE PART OF THE PARENT WAS NOT SUPERIORITY BUT COWARDICE OR INDIFFERENCE
6272-70168-0033 LET IT NOT BE SO WITH US WAS HIS CONCLUSION HE THREW AWAY THE STUMP OF HIS CIGAR AND WENT TO FASTEN THE HALL DOOR I TOOK ONE OF THE BRASS LAMPS PROPOSING TO GO TO BED
6272-70168-0034 AS I PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER ENTRY VERONICA OPENED HER DOOR SHE WAS UNDRESSED AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK IN HER HAND WHICH SHE SHOOK AT ME SAYING
