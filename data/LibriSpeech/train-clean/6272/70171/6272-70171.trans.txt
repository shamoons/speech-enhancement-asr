6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
6272-70171-0002 AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
6272-70171-0005 AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
6272-70171-0008 THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
6272-70171-0014 WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER
6272-70171-0015 SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
6272-70171-0016 PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
6272-70171-0017 PUTTING OTHERS OF A PLAINER MAKE IN THEIR PLACES SHOOK DOWN THE WINDOW CURTAINS ASKED US IF WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE AND QUIETLY DISAPPEARED I OFFERED MOTHER THE WARM WATER AND APPROPRIATED THE BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX I ATE EVERY ONE
6272-70171-0018 UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0020 AND HERE IS A DAMASK NAPKIN FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND THE WASHSTAND AND EVERYTHING STANDS ON A MAT I WONDER IF THIS IS TO BE MY ROOM IT IS PROBABLY THE CHAMBER FOR VISITORS WHY
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0023 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TENDING AND WATCHING THEM THE OLDEST WAS EIGHT YEARS THE YOUNGEST THREE MONTHS COUSIN ALICE GAVE US DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR TASTES AND HABITS DWELLING WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE OF THE BABY
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
6272-70171-0026 I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0029 I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
6272-70171-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0032 THAT STOOD ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS OFTEN AS THAT POSITION WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF GETTING ON FOR THEY EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE GUIDED BY A FIRM HAND EDWARD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR
6272-70171-0033 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
6272-70171-0034 LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
6272-70171-0035 AND THE SCHOLARS SOME SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE COMING DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE HALL TO GO INTO THE ROOMS EACH SIDE OF A GREAT DOOR DOCTOR PRICE WAS BEHIND THEM HE STOPPED WHEN HE SAW US AN INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE AND HE INQUIRED FOR DOCTOR SNELL
6272-70171-0036 AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
6272-70171-0037 TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
6272-70171-0038 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
6272-70171-0039 THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
6272-70171-0041 AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN ROSVILLE SHE WENT TO BOSTON THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON ANXIOUS TO GET SAFELY HOME WITH VERONICA WE PARTED WITH MANY A KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LAST WORDS
