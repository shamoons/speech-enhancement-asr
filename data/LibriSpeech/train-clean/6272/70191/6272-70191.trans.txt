6272-70191-0001 THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
6272-70191-0002 WHO WERE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MOURNERS TO BE SHUT UP WITH US IT WAS PUT UNDER RIGOROUS FUNERAL LAW AND INSPECTED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THEY SUPERVISED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS

6272-70191-0004 I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
6272-70191-0005 THEY REITERATED THE CHARACTER THE PECULIARITIES THE VIRTUES OF THE MOTHER I HAD LOST WHO COULD NEVER BE REPLACED WHO WAS IN A BETTER WORLD HOWEVER I WAS IN A MEASURE
6272-70191-0006 KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
6272-70191-0007 THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
6272-70191-0008 WHICH HE HAD IMPARTED TO HER OF AN ARCH IT MUST BE MADE OF BLACK MARBLE WITH GOLD VEINS AND OUGHT TO STAND IN EGYPT WITH THE WORD PANDEMONIUM ON IT THE KITCHEN WAS THE FOCUS OF INTEREST TO HIM
6272-70191-0009 FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0011 FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
6272-70191-0012 FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
6272-70191-0013 COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO
6272-70191-0014 THE YARD IS FULL OF CARRIAGES ALREADY SOMEBODY HANDED ME GLOVES MY BONNET WAS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF GIVEN TO ME AND THE DOOR OPENED IN THE PASSAGE I HEARD A KNOCKING FROM VERONICA'S ROOM AND CROSSED TO LEARN WHAT SHE WANTED
6272-70191-0015 IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
6272-70191-0016 BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
6272-70191-0017 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
6272-70191-0018 KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
6272-70191-0019 WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
6272-70191-0020 I HAVE SET YOUR BEHAVIOR DOWN TO YOUR WILL YOU MAY BE RIGHT PERHAPS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT ME TOO SHE WAS AGAINST ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A TIMIDITY AND APPREHENSION THAT MADE MY HEART BLEED
6272-70191-0021 I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
6272-70191-0022 A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
6272-70191-0023 THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6272-70191-0025 THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
6272-70191-0026 THAT SOME CONSIDERATE FRIEND TOOK HIM OUT AND AUNT MERCE WEPT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE GREW FAINT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF ME I GAVE HER THE FLACON OF SALTS WHICH REVIVED HER BUT I FELT AS FATHER LOOKED STERN
6272-70191-0027 AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
6272-70191-0028 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0029 AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
6272-70191-0030 THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
6272-70191-0031 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0032 WE LEFT THE CARRIAGE AT THE PALINGS AND WALKED UP THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE MOUNDS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS MARKED MORGESON SOME SO OLD THAT THEY WERE STAINED WITH BLOTCHES OF YELLOW MOSS
6272-70191-0033 SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
6272-70191-0034 IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
6272-70191-0035 ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
6272-70191-0036 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6272-70191-0037 OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
