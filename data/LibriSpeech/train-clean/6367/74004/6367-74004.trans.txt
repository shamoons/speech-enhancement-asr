6367-74004-0000 RUGGLES AND I WERE DOWN ON THE OLD FELLOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY AND SINCE IN A STORY OF THIS KIND WE MUST TELL THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS OR ELSE WHERE IS THE USE OF WRITING A STORY AT ALL
6367-74004-0001 HE IS PRINCIPAL OF THE FRAMPTON ACADEMY THE OLD FELLOW NOT RUGGLES AND HIS NAME IS GEORGE OSBORNE WE HAVE TO CALL HIM MISTER OSBORNE TO HIS FACE BUT HE IS THE OLD FELLOW EVERYWHERE ELSE
6367-74004-0002 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0003 HE IS SPLENDID BIG SIX FOOTER WITH MAGNIFICENT MUSCLES RED CHEEKS AND CURLY YELLOW HAIR I CAN'T SEE HOW HE CAN BE CONTENTED TO SIT DOWN AND TEACH MUSHY ENGLISH LITERATURE AND POETRY AND THAT SORT OF THING
6367-74004-0004 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0006 RUGGLES HANGING HALFWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS USUAL SAW HER AND CALLED ME TO GO AND LOOK OF COURSE I WENT SYLVIA GRANT WAS ALWAYS WORTH LOOKING AT THERE WAS NO GIRL IN FRAMPTON WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO HER WHEN IT CAME TO BEAUTY
6367-74004-0007 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0009 MICKY HAD IT THE WORST AND WE HAD ALL MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT SYLVIA WOULD MARRY MICKY HE WAS SO HANDSOME WE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HELP IT I TELL YOU THEY MADE A DANDY LOOKING COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER WELL AS I SAID BEFORE I TODDLED TO THE WINDOW TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAIR SYLVIA
6367-74004-0010 THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
6367-74004-0011 AND HER BIG BLACKISH BLUE EYES SPARKLED BUT SHE HADN'T BEEN LAUGHING BEFORE OR SPARKLING EITHER
6367-74004-0012 I RATHER SUSPECTED IT FOR AT THE SENIOR PROM THREE NIGHTS BEFORE SHE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT MICKY BUT HAD SAT IN A CORNER AND TALKED TO THE OLD FELLOW HE DIDN'T DO MUCH TALKING HE WAS TOO SHY AND HE LOOKED MIGHTY UNCOMFORTABLE
6367-74004-0013 BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE
6367-74004-0014 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0015 LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
6367-74004-0016 YOU'LL HAVE TO RUGGLES YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE RUGGLES TURNED RED I KNOW HE WRITES TO EM WHITE IN VACATIONS I'LL DO MY BEST HE SAID QUITE MEEKLY THAT IS I'LL COMPOSE IT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COPY IT
6367-74004-0017 YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
6367-74004-0018 SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE OLD FELLOW A BIT I KNOW FROM THE WAY SHE ACTS WITH HIM SHE'S ALWAYS SO COOL AND STIFF WHEN HE'S ABOUT NOT A BIT LIKE SHE IS WITH THE OTHER PROFESSORS WELL RUGGLES WROTE THE LETTER AT FIRST HE TRIED TO PASS IT OFF ON ME AS HIS OWN COMPOSITION
6367-74004-0019 BUT I KNOW A FEW LITTLE THINGS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT RUGGLES COULDN'T HAVE MADE UP THAT LETTER ANY MORE THAN HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN A SONNET I TOLD HIM SO AND MADE HIM OWN UP HE HAD A COPY OF AN OLD LETTER THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO HIS SISTER BY HER YOUNG MAN
6367-74004-0020 ANYHOW THAT LETTER JUST FILLED THE BILL IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED RUGGLES'S SISTER'S YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE POSSESSED LOTS OF ABILITY HE WAS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE MICKY
6367-74004-0021 HE STARTED IN BY TELLING HER HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER AND WHAT AN ANGEL OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER HOW UNWORTHY HE FELT HIMSELF OF HER AND HOW LITTLE HOPE HE HAD THAT SHE COULD EVER CARE FOR HIM
6367-74004-0022 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0023 GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
6367-74004-0024 IT WAS THE SMARTEST EVENT OF THE TERM AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OF COURSE SYLVIA GRANT SYLVIA LOOKED STUNNING
6367-74004-0025 AND AVOIDED POOR MICKY SO SKILFULLY THAT IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO WATCH HER THE OLD FELLOW CAME IN LATE WITH HIS TIE ALL CROOKED AS IT ALWAYS WAS I SAW SYLVIA BLUSH AND NUDGED RUGGLES TO LOOK SHE'S THINKING OF THE LETTER HE SAID
6367-74004-0026 RUGGLES AND I NEVER MEANT TO LISTEN UPON MY WORD WE DIDN'T IT WAS PURE ACCIDENT WE WERE IN BEHIND THE FLAGS AND PALMS IN THE MODERN LANGUAGES ROOM FIXING UP A PLAN HOW TO GET EM AND JENNIE OFF FOR A MOONLIT STROLL IN THE GROUNDS
6367-74004-0027 SYLVIA STILL LOOKED SMILING AND HAPPY NOT A BIT MAD AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT JUST KIND OF SHY AND RADIANT AS FOR THE OLD FELLOW HE LOOKED AS EM WHITE WOULD SAY AS SPHINX LIKE AS EVER
6367-74004-0028 OR SAID MY LETTER OR SHOWN SURPRISE IN SOME WAY
6367-74004-0029 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT SYLVIA FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID KIND OF DRILY AH DID YOU YES SAID SYLVIA NOT MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER IT IT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH I NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU
6367-74004-0030 HIS VOICE ACTUALLY TREMBLED I I DON'T THINK I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW SAID SYLVIA TURNING HER HEAD AWAY YOU SEE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HELP CARING SYLVIA
6367-74004-0031 YOU NEVER SAW SUCH A TRANSFORMATION AS CAME OVER THE OLD FELLOW HIS EYES JUST BLAZED BUT HIS FACE WENT WHITE HE BENT FORWARD AND TOOK HER HAND SYLVIA
6367-74004-0032 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
6367-74004-0033 I'VE ALWAYS CARED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL COMING HERE TO SCHOOL AND BREAKING MY HEART OVER MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH I HATED THEM JUST TO BE IN YOUR CLASS WHY WHY
6367-74004-0034 I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
6367-74004-0035 HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
6367-74004-0036 THERE THEY BOTH WERE GOING ON AT THE SILLIEST RATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND HOW THE OLD FELLOW THOUGHT SHE LOVED MICKY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS AWFUL I NEVER THOUGHT THE OLD FELLOW OR SYLVIA EITHER COULD BE SO SPOONEY
6367-74004-0037 RUGGLES AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING ON EARTH TO BE OUT OF THAT WE KNEW WE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE AND WE FELT AS FOOLISH AS FLATFISH IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN THE OLD FELLOW AND SYLVIA GOT UP AT LAST AND TRAILED AWAY BOTH OF THEM LOOKING IDIOTICALLY HAPPY
