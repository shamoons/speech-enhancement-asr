6415-100596-0000 THE ELUSIVE KATE FERRIS THE MYSTERIOUS KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0001 FOR A WHOLE SEMESTER ENTERED UPON HER COLLEGE CAREER IN AN ENTIRELY UNPREMEDITATED AND IMPROMPTU MANNER IT BEGAN ONE DAY AWAY BACK IN NOVEMBER
6415-100596-0002 GEORGIE STOPPED TO EXAMINE SOME LOOSE SHEETS OF PAPER WHICH WERE IMPALED UPON THE DOOR WHAT'S THIS PATTY OH THAT'S THE REGISTRATION LIST FOR THE GERMAN CLUB PRISCILLA'S SECRETARY YOU KNOW AND EVERY ONE WHO WANTS TO JOIN COMES HERE
6415-100596-0003 THE STUDY HAS BEEN SO FULL OF FRESHMEN ALL THE TIME THAT I TOLD HER TO HANG IT ON THE DOOR AND LET THEM JOIN OUTSIDE IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY PATTY TURNED THE LEAVES AND RAN HER EYES DOWN THE LIST OF SPRAWLING SIGNATURES IT'S A POPULAR ORGANIZATION ISN'T IT
6415-100596-0004 THE FRESHMEN ARE SIMPLY SCRAMBLING TO GET IN THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW FRAEULEIN SCHERIN HOW MUCH INTEREST THEY TAKE IN THE SUBJECT GEORGIE LAUGHED PATTY PICKED UP THE PENCIL WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
6415-100596-0005 I KNOW PRISCILLA WOULD BE GRATIFIED NO THANK YOU I PAY CLUB DUES ENOUGH ALREADY I'M AFRAID I'M NOT EXACTLY ELIGIBLE MYSELF AS I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY SHARP PENCIL THOUGH THAT I HATE NOT TO WRITE WITH IT
6415-100596-0006 PATTY POISED THE PENCIL A MOMENT AND ABSTRACTEDLY TRACED THE NAME KATE FERRIS GEORGIE LAUGHED IF THERE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE A KATE FERRIS IN COLLEGE SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO FIND HERSELF A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN CLUB
6415-100596-0007 AND THE INCIDENT WAS FORGOTTEN A FEW DAYS LATER THE TWO CAME IN FROM CLASS TO FIND PRISCILLA AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN CLUB SITTING ON THE DIVAN WITH THEIR HEADS TOGETHER FRANTICALLY TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE CATALOGUE
6415-100596-0008 SHE ISN'T A SOPHOMORE THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED SHE MUST BE A FRESHMAN PRISCILLA LOOK AGAIN
6415-100596-0009 GEORGIE AND PATTY EXCHANGED GLANCES AND INQUIRED THE TROUBLE A GIRL NAMED KATE FERRIS HAS REGISTERED FOR THE GERMAN CLUB AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE CLASSES AND THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY SUCH GIRL IN COLLEGE POSSIBLY A SPECIAL
6415-100596-0010 PRISCILLA PRODUCED THE REGISTRATION LIST AND TRIUMPHANTLY EXHIBITED AN UNMISTAKABLE KATE FERRIS THEY FORGOT TO PUT HER IN THE CATALOGUE I NEVER KNEW THEM TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE BEFORE SAID THE PRESIDENT DUBIOUSLY I DON'T BELIEVE WE'D BETTER PUT HER IN THE ROLL BOOK
6415-100596-0011 SEVERAL WEEKS LATER PRISCILLA WAS ENGAGED IN LABORIOUSLY TURNING THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING INTO GRAMMATICAL GERMAN AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF SHE REMARKED TO PATTY DO YOU KNOW
6415-100596-0012 SHE HASN'T PAID HER DUES AND AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT
6415-100596-0013 BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES LATELY KATE FERRIS PRISCILLA EXHIBITED THE NOTE TO THE PRESIDENT AS A TANGIBLE PROOF THAT KATE FERRIS STILL EXISTED AND REINSCRIBED THE NAME IN THE ROLL BOOK
6415-100596-0014 A FEW WEEKS LATER SHE FOUND A SECOND NOTE ON HER DOOR BLOCK DEAR MISS POND AS I AM VERY BUSY WITH MY CLASS WORK I FIND THAT I HAVE NOT TIME TO ATTEND THE GERMAN CLUB MEETINGS AND SO HAVE DECIDED TO RESIGN
6415-100596-0015 I LEFT MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON THE BOOKCASE KATE FERRIS AS PRISCILLA SCRATCHED THE NAME OUT OF THE ROLL BOOK AGAIN SHE REMARKED TO PATTY
6415-100596-0016 AND ADVISED ME TO STAY IN IT SO I SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL NOT PRESENT MY LETTER AT THE MEETING AFTER ALL AS I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER ADVICE KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0017 PRISCILLA TOSSED THE NOTE TO PATTY WITH A GROAN AND GETTING OUT THE ROLL BOOK SHE TURNED TO THE F AND REENROLLED KATE FERRIS PATTY SYMPATHETICALLY WATCHED THE PROCESS OVER HER SHOULDER THE BOOK IS GETTING SO THIN IN THAT SPOT SHE LAUGHED
6415-100596-0018 THAT KATE FERRIS IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE IF SHE CHANGES HER MIND MANY MORE TIMES THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
6415-100596-0019 PRISCILLA DECLARED SHE'S MADE ME SO MUCH TROUBLE THAT I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE DID ASK FRAEULEIN SCHERIN
6415-100596-0020 I HAVE SO MANY FRESHMEN SHE APOLOGIZED I CANNOT ALL OF THEM WITH THEIR QUEER NAMES REMEMBER PRISCILLA INQUIRED ABOUT KATE FERRIS FROM THE FRESHMEN SHE KNEW
6415-100596-0021 PRISCILLA KEPT HEARING ABOUT THE GIRL ON ALL SIDES BUT COULD NEVER CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HER
6415-100596-0022 BUT PRISCILLA ALWAYS HAPPENED TO BE OUT HER NAME WAS POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD FOR HAVING LIBRARY BOOKS THAT WERE OVERDUE SHE EVEN WROTE A PAPER FOR ONE OF THE GERMAN CLUB MEETINGS GEORGIE WAS NOT A FACILE GERMAN SCHOLAR AND IT HAD REQUIRED A WHOLE SATURDAY
6415-100596-0023 I AM GOING TO INVITE KATE FERRIS SHE ANNOUNCED I INSIST UPON FINDING OUT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE DO SAID PATTY I SHOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MYSELF THE INVITATION WAS DESPATCHED AND ON THE NEXT DAY PRISCILLA RECEIVED A FORMAL ACCEPTANCE
6415-100596-0024 ON THE EVENING OF THE TEA AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE AND THE FURNITURE HAD BEEN MOVED BACK THE WEARY HOSTESSES IN SOMEWHAT RUMPLED EVENING DRESSES A CONSIDERABLE CRUSH RESULTS WHEN FIFTY ARE ENTERTAINED IN A ROOM WHOSE UTMOST CAPACITY IS FIFTEEN
6415-100596-0025 WERE REENTERTAINING ONE OR TWO FRIENDS ON THE LETTUCE SANDWICHES AND CAKES THE OBLIGING GUESTS HAD FAILED TO CONSUME THE COMPANY AND THE CLOTHES HAVING PASSED IN REVIEW THE CONVERSATION FLAGGED A LITTLE AND GEORGIE SUDDENLY ASKED
6415-100596-0026 PRISCILLA KNIT HER BROWS SHE COULDN'T HAVE COME I KEPT WATCHING FOR HER ALL THE EVENING IT'S STRANGE ISN'T IT WHEN SHE WAS SO CAREFUL TO SEND AN ACCEPTANCE I'M GROWING POSITIVELY
6415-100596-0027 I BEGIN TO THINK SO MYSELF SAID PATTY THE NEXT MORNING'S MAIL BROUGHT A BUNCH OF VIOLETS AND AN APOLOGY FROM KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0028 IT'S POSITIVELY UNCANNY PRISCILLA DECLARED I SHALL GO TO THE REGISTRAR AND TELL HER THAT THIS KATE FERRIS IS NEITHER DOWN IN THE CATALOGUE NOR THE COLLEGE DIRECTORY AND FIND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES
6415-100596-0029 SHE INSISTS THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SUCH PERSON IN COLLEGE AND THAT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE NAME DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO ABSURD THAT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION PATTY AGREED AMICABLY
6415-100596-0030 PERHAPS IT IS HARRIS INSTEAD OF FERRIS PRISCILLA FACED HER OMINOUSLY YOU READ THE NAME YOURSELF IT WAS AS PLAIN AS PRINTING WE'RE ALL LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES PATTY MURMURED SOOTHINGLY DO YOU KNOW
6415-100596-0031 SAID GEORGIE I BEGIN TO THINK IT'S ALL A HALLUCINATION AND THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY KATE FERRIS IT'S STRANGE OF COURSE BUT NOT ANY STRANGER THAN SOME OF THOSE CASES YOU READ ABOUT IN PSYCHOLOGY
6415-100596-0032 I'M AFRAID SO SIGHED PATTY IT'S BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING BUT SHE IS REALLY GETTING SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT AND I DON'T DARE MENTION KATE FERRIS'S NAME WHEN WE'RE ALONE
6415-100596-0033 PATTY SHOOK HER HEAD NOT JUST NOW I SHOULDN'T DARE SHE BELIEVES IN CORPORAL PUNISHMENT A FEW DAYS LATER PRISCILLA RECEIVED ANOTHER NOTE DIRECTED IN THE HAND SHE HAD COME TO DREAD SHE THREW IT INTO THE WASTE BASKET UNOPENED
6415-100596-0034 BUT CURIOSITY PREVAILING SHE DREW IT OUT AGAIN AND READ IT DEAR MISS POND AS I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE COLLEGE ON ACCOUNT OF MY HEALTH I INCLOSE MY RESIGNATION TO THE GERMAN CLUB I THANK YOU VERY SINCERELY FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME THIS YEAR
6415-100596-0035 WHERE KATE FERRIS'S NAME HAD BEEN CHANGED HER MIND AGAIN PATTY ASKED PLEASANTLY SHE'S LEFT COLLEGE PRISCILLA SNAPPED AND DON'T YOU EVER MENTION HER NAME TO ME AGAIN PATTY SIGHED SYMPATHETICALLY AND REMARKED TO THE ROOM IN GENERAL
