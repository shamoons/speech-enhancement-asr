6415-111615-0000 OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
6415-111615-0001 IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
6415-111615-0002 THERE IS NOTHING SO AMAZING TO HIM AS TO FIND THAT ANY ONE REALLY ENJOYS HIS STUFF POOR SOUL HE REMEMBERS HOW HE GROANED OVER IT AT HIS DESK HE REMEMBERS THE HOURS HE SAT WITH LACK LUSTRE EYE AND ADDLED BRAIN
6415-111615-0003 BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
6415-111615-0004 I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A TRY AT WRITING A COLUMN HEAVEN HELP ME I THINK I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS BORN FOR THE JOB I MAY AS WELL BE CANDID THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF INSERTING THE FOLLOWING AD IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0005 I FIND A MEMORANDUM OF IT IN MY SCRAP BOOK HUMORIST YOUNG AND UNTAMED LINEAL DESCENDENT OF EUGENE FIELD FRANK STOCKTON AND FRANCOIS RABELAIS DESIRES TO RUN A COLUMN IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0006 A GUARANTEED CIRCULATION GETTER SAID HUMORIST CAN ALSO SUPPLY EXCELLENT VEINS OF PHILOSOPHY POETRY SATIRE UPLIFT GLAD MATERIAL AND INDISCRIMINATE MUSINGS
6415-111615-0007 REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY NEWSPAPER DESIRING A REALLY UNUSUAL EDITORIAL FEATURE ADDRESS HUMORIST ET CETERA SO BESOTTED WAS I I WOULD HAVE PAID TO HAVE THIS PRINTED IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSELLED BY AN OLDER AND WISER HEAD
6415-111615-0008 I INSTANCE THIS TO SHOW THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO BEGIN HIS JOB WITH THE CONCEPTION THAT IT IS TO BE A PERPETUAL UPROAR OF MIRTH AND HIGH SPIRITS THIS LASTS ABOUT A WEEK
6415-111615-0009 HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THE MOST ELUSIVE AND GROTESQUE MATERIAL HE KNOWS HIS OWN MIND AND THE UNHAPPY CREATURE EVERLASTINGLY PROBING HIMSELF IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS SO RARE IN MINDS A THOUGHT IS LIKELY TO END IN A FERMENT OF BITTERNESS
6415-111615-0010 IF YOU HAVE TO BE ENDLESSLY SPECULATING WATCHING AND MAKING MENTAL NOTES YOUR BRAIN GEARS SOON GET A HOT BOX THE ORIGINAL OF ALL PARAGRAPHERS
6415-111615-0011 CAME VERY NEAR ENDING AS A COMPLETE CYNIC THOUGH IN WHAT F P A WOULD CALL HIS LASTLINE HE MANAGED TO WRIGGLE INTO A MORE HOPEFUL MOOD THE FIRST VALUABLE DISCOVERY THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO MAKE IS THAT ALL MINDS ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME
6415-111615-0012 THE DOCTORS TELL US THAT ALL PATENT MEDICINES ARE BUILT ON A STOCK FORMULA A SEDATIVE A PURGE AND A BITTER IF YOU ARE TO MAKE STEADY COLUMN TOPERS OUT OF YOUR READERS YOUR DAILY DOSE MUST
6415-111615-0013 AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AVERAGE UP TO THAT SAME PRESCRIPTION IF YOU EMPLOY THE PURGE ALL THE TIME OR THE SEDATIVE OR THE ACID YOUR CLIENTS WILL SOON ASK FOR SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER LABEL
6415-111615-0014 IT IS HARD TO GET THE COLYUMIST TO ADMIT THIS FOR HE FEARS SPOOFING WORSE THAN THE DEVIL BUT IT IS EMINENTLY TRUE IF I WERE THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0015 THE FOLLOWING WORDS FROM ISAIAH THE BEST OF ALL WATCHWORDS FOR ALL WHO WRITE WOE UNTO THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER
6415-111615-0016 THE MOST PAINFUL PRIVILEGE OF THE COLYUMIST'S JOB IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DROP IN TO SEE HIM USUALLY WHEN HE IS IMPRECATING HIS WAY TOWARD THE HOUR OF GOING TO PRESS THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE GREAT AND SALUTARY HUMAN INSTINCT AGAINST WORK
6415-111615-0017 YET NOW AND THEN HE GETS A GLIMPSE INTO A HUMAN VEXATION SO SINCERE SO HONEST AND SO MOVING THAT HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE TYPEWRITER WITH A SIGH HE WONDERS HOW ONE DARE APPROACH THE CHRONICLING OF THIS MUDDLED PANORAMA
6415-111615-0018 WITH ANYTHING BUT HUMILITY AND DESPAIR FRANK HARRIS ONCE SAID OF OSCAR WILDE IF ENGLAND INSISTS ON TREATING HER CRIMINALS LIKE THIS SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY SIMILARLY
6415-111615-0019 IF THE PUBLIC INSISTS ON BRINGING ITS WOES TO ITS COLYUMISTS IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY COLYUMISTS THEN THE BATTERED JESTER TURNS AGAIN TO HIS MACHINE AND TICKS OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
6415-111615-0020 A PESSIMIST HE SAYS IS A MAN WHO WEARS BOTH BELT AND SUSPENDERS WHEN A BIG JEWELLERY FIRM IN THE CITY PUTS OUT A LARGE AD BAILEY BANKS AND BIDDLE COMPANY WATCHES FOR WOMEN OF SUPERIOR DESIGN AND PERFECTION OF MOVEMENT
6415-111615-0021 ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
6415-111615-0022 ON THE STREETS MAKING HIMSELF THE REPORTER OF THE MOODS AND ODDITIES OF MEN THE BETTER HIS STUFF WILL BE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS JOB OUGHT TO BE GOOD TRAINING FOR A NOVELIST AS IT TEACHES HIM A HABIT OF HUMAN SENSITIVENESS
6415-111615-0023 HE BECOMES FILLED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CURIOSITY ABOUT THE MOTIVES AND PURPOSES OF THE PEOPLE HE SEES
6415-111615-0024 WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
6415-111615-0025 THERE HE STOOD A SORT OF UNSUCCESSFUL CYRUS CURTIS VERY DIMINUTIVE HIS GRAY HAIR RATHER LONG ABAFT HIS NECK HIS YELLOWISH STRAW HAT WITH CURLY BRIM TILTED BACKWARD AS THOUGH IN PERPLEXITY
6415-111615-0026 HIS TIMID AND ABSORBED BLUE EYES PORING OVER HIS MEMORANDUM BOOK WHICH WAS FULL OF PENCILLED NOTES HE HAD A SLIGHTLY UNKEMPT BRIEF BEARD AND WHISKERS HIS CHEEK BONES PINKISH HIS LINEN A LITTLE FRAYED THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY PATHETIC ABOUT HIM
6415-111615-0027 AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
6415-111615-0028 THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
6415-111615-0029 THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST
6415-111615-0030 AND IT IS CARRIED ON IN SURROUNDINGS OF EXTRAORDINARY STIMULATION AND DIFFICULTY IT IS HEART RACKING TO STRUGGLE DAY BY DAY AMID INCESSANT INTERRUPTION AND MELEE TO SNATCH OUT OF THE HURLY BURLY SOME SHREDS OF HUMOUR OR PATHOS OR
6415-111615-0031 DARE ONE SAY BEAUTY AND PHRASE THEM INTELLIGIBLY BUT IT IS FUN ONE NEVER BUYS A PACKAGE OF TOBACCO CROSSES A CITY SQUARE ENTERS A TROLLEY CAR OR STUDIES A SHOP WINDOW WITHOUT TRYING IN A BAFFLED HOPELESS WAY
6415-111615-0032 TO PEER THROUGH THE FRONTAGE OF THE EXPERIENCE TO FIND SOME GLIMMER OF THE THOUGHTS EMOTIONS AND MEANINGS BEHIND AND IN THE LONG RUN SUCH A HABIT OF INQUIRY MUST BEAR FRUIT IN UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY JOSEPH CONRAD
6415-111615-0033 WHO SEEMS BY THE WAY TO BE MORE READ BY NEWSPAPER MEN THAN ANY OTHER WRITER PUT VERY NOBLY THE PINNACLE OF ALL SCRIBBLERS DREAMS WHEN HE SAID THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS DESERVE THE TRIBUTE OF A SIGH WHICH IS NOT A SOB A SMILE
6415-111615-0034 WHICH IS NOT A GRIN SO MUCH WITH APOLOGY FOR THE IDEALS OF THE COLYUMIST IF HE BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR OF MOCKERY OF COURSE IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS AND TRAVAIL OF HIS JOB YOU WILL FIND HIM FAR DIFFERENT
6415-111615-0035 YOU MAY KNOW HIM BY A SUNKEN BROODING EYE CLOTHING MARRED BY MUCH TOBACCO AND A CHAFED AND TETCHY HUMOUR TOWARD THE HOUR OF FIVE P M HAVING BITTERLY SCHOOLED HIMSELF TO SEE MEN AS PARAGRAPHS WALKING
6415-111615-0036 HE FINDS THAT HIS MOST AUGUST MUSINGS HAVE A HABIT OF STEWING THEMSELVES DOWN TO SOME FEROCIOUS OR JOCULAR THREE LINE COMMENT
6415-111615-0037 TO CHURN UP FROM THE TYPEWRITER SOME LYRIC THAT WILL ROCK WITH BLUE SEAS AND FRANTIC HEARTS
6415-111615-0038 POOR SOUL HE IS LIKE ONE CONDEMNED TO HARANGUE THE VAST IDIOTIC WORLD THROUGH A KEYHOLE WHENCE HIS ANGUISH ISSUES THIN AND FAINT YET WHO WILL SAY THAT ALL HIS LABOUR IS WHOLLY VAIN
6415-111615-0039 PERHAPS SOME DAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL CROWN A COLYUMIST LAUREATE SOME MAJESTIC SAGE WITH ANCIENT PATIENT BLUE EYES AND A SNOWY BEARD NOBLY STAINED WITH NICOTINE WHOSE UTTERANCES WILL BE HEEDED WITH SHUDDERING RESPECT
