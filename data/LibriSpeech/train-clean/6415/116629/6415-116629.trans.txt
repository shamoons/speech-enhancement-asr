6415-116629-0009 I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOMEBODY COMES OVER FROM FOHRENSEE AND EXPLAINS IT TO THEM HE DOES NOT BELONG THERE BUT I GUESS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM

6415-116629-0011 DIETRICH PUTS IN MORE MONEY EVERY TIME JOST HAS NOTHING TO PUT IN BUT PROMISES HE TELLS DIETRICH ALL THE TIME THAT PRESENTLY THE WINNINGS WILL BEGIN TO FLOW IN AND SAYS THAT AT FIRST A FELLOW MUST EXPECT TO LOSE SO AS TO WIN ALL THE MORE IN THE END

6415-116629-0013 DO YOU THINK SHE WILL HAVE HIM THE QUESTION SEEMED TO INTEREST JUDITH FOR SHE STOOD STOCK STILL WHO WHOM WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN VERONICA AND JOST DO YOU THINK SHE WILL TAKE HIM
6415-116629-0014 AS BLASI SPOKE HE CAME SLOWLY NEARER TO JUDITH HE HAS BEEN SAYING SOME THINGS LATELY THAT MADE ME THINK SO
6415-116629-0015 I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN HE WENT ON BUT I AM NOT SO VERY STUPID AS YOU THINK IT CERTAINLY MEANS SOMETHING WHEN SHE IS SO CHANGED JOST SAYS THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THAT DIETRICH HAS BEEN ABOUT
6415-116629-0016 AND SHE IS HOT WITH ANGER AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE HAS NOT TOLD HER ABOUT IT HIMSELF JOST SAYS THAT IF HE ONLY MENTIONS DIETRICH'S NAME BEFORE HER SHE LOOKS LIKE A WILD CAT IN A MOMENT
6415-116629-0017 AND HE SAYS TOO THAT HE HAS NOTICED FOR SOME TIME THAT SHE HAS NO OBJECTION TO LETTING DIETRICH SEE THAT SHE CAN GET ALONG VERY WELL WITHOUT HIS HELP AND YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE'S ANGRY
6415-116629-0018 AND MUTTERED I WONDER IF SHE WANTS TO GET HIM TOO
6415-116629-0019 YES SHE IS SHE IS SHE IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE IS ANGRY NOW JUDITH HAD LOOKED UPON HER NEIGHBOR'S BOY FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP AS IF HE BELONGED TO HER HE WAS HER PRIME
6415-116629-0020 THIS VERY RESERVE HOWEVER WAS RATHER DISTASTEFUL TO JUDITH AS REGARDED HERSELF BUT SHE LIKED IT TOWARDS OTHERS SHE HAD PLANNED IT ALL OUT THAT DIETRICH SHOULD MARRY VERONICA SOON AFTER THE CONFIRMATION THAT THEY SHOULD SET UP A PRETTY LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT AND BE HER BELOVED NEIGHBORS
6415-116629-0021 JUDITH BOUNCED VIOLENTLY INTO THE KITCHEN AND SET HER JUG DOWN WITH SUCH A BANG THAT THE WATER SPURTED UP INTO THE AIR AND NO ONE CAN GET A WORD OUT OF HER EITHER IT IS EXACTLY AS IF ALL THE OIL HAD BEEN BURNED OUT THIS LAST REMARK REFERRED TO GERTRUDE
6415-116629-0022 WHO HAD GREATLY ALTERED DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS SHE HAD NO LONGER THE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN NOTED FOR SHE HAD GROWN VERY QUIET AND SILENT SHE EVEN AVOIDED HER OLD AND WELL TRIED FRIEND JUDITH
6415-116629-0023 AND IF THE LATTER SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS OR HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE GERTRUDE WOULD GIVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAD NO TIME TO STOP TO TALK GERTRUDE KNEW WHERE DIETRICH SPENT HIS EVENINGS SHE HAD EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT MORE THAN ONCE
6415-116629-0024 HE HAD ANSWERED THAT HE MUST KEEP ON THERE FOR AWHILE TILL A CERTAIN UNDERTAKING WHICH HE HAD STARTED WITH JOST WAS FAIRLY UNDER WAY HE ASSURED HER THAT THIS AFFAIR WAS CERTAIN TO TURN OUT ALL RIGHT AND THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD BE SURPRISED AND SATISFIED AT THE RESULT
6415-116629-0025 HE KNEW FROM SOME ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD IT THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL HE HAD TO DRAW LARGE SUMS SEVERAL TIMES FOR HIMSELF AND ALSO FOR JOST BUT HE WAS SANGUINE THAT IN A SHORT TIME IT WOULD ALL BE PAID BACK WITH INTEREST
6415-116629-0026 GERTRUDE HERSELF COULD SCARCELY UNDERSTAND POOR GERTRUDE ONE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM SHE HEARD HER SON LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH HASTY STEPS IT HAD BECOME A REGULAR THING NOW SHE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HERSELF
6415-116629-0027 AH HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THIS GO ON BUT SHE TRIED HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SOON COME TO AN END AND HER SON WOULD RESUME HIS FORMER ORDERLY AND HAPPY MODE OF LIFE BUT THIS EVENING SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY IN HER BEDROOM
6415-116629-0028 SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN THE MOON PEEPED OUT FROM BETWEEN THE FLYING CLOUDS AND SHONE PEACEFULLY DOWN UPON THE TREES AND THE NEAT FLOWER BEDS GERTRUDE SEATED HERSELF UPON A SMALL BENCH UNDER THE APPLE TREE AND GAZED ABOUT THE GARDEN
6415-116629-0029 BUT HE KNEW THE STRAIGHT ROAD AND WOULD NOT HIS STEPS TURN BACK TO IT AGAIN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN HER LITTLE DIETERLI LOVED GOOD AND ORDERLY CONDUCT IT COULD NOT BE THAT HE HAD LOST HIS LOVE FOR IT
6415-116629-0030 THAT IN THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF LIFE LIES INWARD AND OUTWARD BLESSING SHE RECALLED THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS BORNE FROM THE HOUSE TO HIS BURIAL SHE HAD TAKEN THE CHILDREN BY THE HAND AND STUPEFIED WITH PAIN WAS ABOUT TO PUT THEM TO BED
6415-116629-0031 BUT DIETERLI OBJECTED SAYING NO MOTHER NO IT IS NOT GOOD TO GO TO BED BEFORE YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS DID HER BOY EVER PRAY NOW OH DIETERLI MY SON YOU ARE WANDERING AWAY BUT YOU KNOW THE WAY HOME
6415-116629-0032 SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHE FOLDED HER HANDS IN PRAYER FOR HER HABIT WAS TO LAY ALL HER TROUBLES BEFORE GOD HER SUPPORTER AND COMFORTER AT THIS MOMENT SHE HEARD THROUGH THE STILLNESS LOUD SHOUTS AND CRIES FIRST AT A DISTANCE
6415-116629-0033 THEN NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL THEY GREW INTO A WILD TUMULT THEN MANY OF THE VOICES SEEMED TO SCATTER IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHILE SOME SOUNDED AS IF APPROACHING THE GARDEN A VAGUE FEAR SEIZED GERTRUDE
6415-116629-0034 THREE FELLOWS SHOUTING AND CALLING PASSED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE SHE RECOGNIZED ONE OF THE VOICES JOST SHE CRIED FEEBLY JOST WHAT IS IT WHERE IS DIETRICH THERE WAS NO ANSWER JOST DID NOT OR WOULD NOT HEAR
6415-116629-0035 SAID GERTRUDE WHITE WITH TERROR DON'T LEAVE ME SO BUT TELL ME BLASI WHY DIETRICH HASN'T COME HOME WITH THE REST OF YOU BLASI HAD TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR DIETRICH'S MOTHER TO RUN AWAY FROM HER WHEN SHE PUT A DIRECT QUESTION TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE ESCAPED
6415-116629-0036 TWO MEN WERE KILLED SOME ONE STOLE THE CATTLE DEALER'S MONEY BAG IS DIETRICH KILLED SPEAK OUT BROKE IN GERTRUDE TREMBLING NO HE STRUCK ABOUT HIM BRAVELY TILL ONE OF THE FELLOWS GOT ENOUGH OF IT AND LAY DEAD ON THE GROUND
6415-116629-0037 AND THEN HE MADE OFF WITH THIS
6415-116629-0038 GERTRUDE MOUNTED WEARILY TO HER ROOM AS IF HER LAST DAY WAS COME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER BED AND WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT FILLED THE ROOM STILL SHE SAT THERE LISTENING IN TREMBLING ANXIETY
6415-116629-0039 AS SHE HAD LISTENED THROUGH ALL THE LONG NIGHT IN VAIN DIETRICH HAD NOT COME HOME IN THE NIGHT
