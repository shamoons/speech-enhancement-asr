6437-66173-0000 CHAPTER TEN I FIGHT CONWAY THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER WHO CHERISHED A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE CENTIPEDES HAD HAD A HAND IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT PERSON WAS CONWAY
6437-66173-0001 HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
6437-66173-0002 AND SCOWLED IN THE MOST THREATENING WAY OVER HIS SUMS CONWAY HAD AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PECULIARLY HIS OWN THAT OF THROWING HIS THUMBS OUT OF JOINT AT WILL SOMETIMES WHILE ABSORBED IN STUDY OR ON BECOMING NERVOUS AT RECITATION
6437-66173-0003 HE PERFORMED THE FEAT UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE MORNING HIS THUMBS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISLOCATION INDICATING GREAT MENTAL AGITATION ON THE PART OF THE OWNER WE FULLY EXPECTED AN OUTBREAK FROM HIM AT RECESS
6437-66173-0004 BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
6437-66173-0005 WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
6437-66173-0006 AND ON STEPPING INTO THE PLAYGROUND SAW MY LITTLE FRIEND PLASTERED AS IT WERE UP AGAINST THE FENCE AND CONWAY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM READY TO DELIVER A BLOW ON THE UPTURNED UNPROTECTED FACE WHOSE GENTLENESS WOULD HAVE STAYED ANY ARM BUT A COWARD'S
6437-66173-0007 BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
6437-66173-0008 HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
6437-66173-0009 BUT THEY WERE NOT THE TEARS OF DEFEAT THEY WERE MERELY THE INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE WHICH NATURE PAID TO THE DEPARTED TRESSES IN A SECOND MY LITTLE JACKET LAY ON THE GROUND AND I STOOD ON GUARD RESTING LIGHTLY ON MY RIGHT LEG
6437-66173-0010 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0011 AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
6437-66173-0012 IT WAS A CUSTOM WITH THE LARGER PUPILS TO RETURN TO THE PLAYGROUND AFTER SCHOOL AND PLAY BASEBALL UNTIL SUNDOWN THE TOWN AUTHORITIES HAD PROHIBITED BALL PLAYING ON THE SQUARE AND THERE BEING NO OTHER AVAILABLE PLACE
6437-66173-0013 THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
6437-66173-0014 IS IT A FIGHT ASKED PHIL ADAMS WHO SAW BY OUR FRESHNESS THAT WE HAD NOT YET GOT TO WORK YES IT'S A FIGHT I ANSWERED UNLESS CONWAY WILL ASK WALLACE'S PARDON PROMISE NEVER TO HECTOR ME IN FUTURE
6437-66173-0015 AND PUT BACK MY HAIR THIS LAST CONDITION WAS RATHER A STAGGERER I SHA'N'T DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONWAY SULKILY THEN THE THING MUST GO ON SAID ADAMS WITH DIGNITY
6437-66173-0016 RODGERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR SECOND CONWAY BAILEY COME HERE WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT HE WAS THRASHING BINNY WALLACE NO I WASN'T INTERRUPTED CONWAY
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0018 COOL IS THE WORD SAID ADAMS AS HE BOUND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY HEAD AND CAREFULLY TUCKED AWAY THE LONG STRAGGLING LOCKS THAT OFFERED A TEMPTING ADVANTAGE TO THE ENEMY WHO EVER HEARD OF A FELLOW WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR GOING INTO ACTION
6437-66173-0019 MUTTERED PHIL TWITCHING THE HANDKERCHIEF TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WERE SECURELY TIED HE THEN LOOSENED MY GALLOWSES BRACES AND BUCKLED THEM TIGHTLY ABOVE MY HIPS NOW THEN BANTAM NEVER SAY DIE
6437-66173-0020 CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
6437-66173-0021 IS YOUR MAN READY ASKED PHIL ADAMS ADDRESSING RODGERS READY KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE GATE TOM
6437-66173-0022 AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
6437-66173-0023 ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
6437-66173-0024 YOU'LL GET NO DESCRIPTION OF IT FROM ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PROVE VERY POOR READING AND NOT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY REVOLT AGAINST CONWAY'S TYRANNY UNJUSTIFIABLE I HAD BORNE CONWAY'S PERSECUTIONS FOR MANY MONTHS WITH LAMB LIKE PATIENCE
6437-66173-0025 I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
6437-66173-0026 THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
6437-66173-0027 I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
6437-66173-0028 THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
6437-66173-0029 EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
6437-66173-0030 THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO TO A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT SAY NO IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE CARE YOU MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOURSELF WHY YOU SAY NO IT'S A PROOF OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE IF DONE FROM TRUE CHRISTIAN MOTIVES
6437-66173-0031 IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
6437-66173-0032 FIGHT IT OUT AND DON'T GIVE IN WHILE YOU CAN STAND AND SEE AND DON'T GIVE IN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE FOR I COULD STAND VERY LITTLE AND SEE NOT AT ALL HAVING POMMELLED THE SCHOOL PUMP FOR THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS
6437-66173-0033 WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
6437-66173-0034 CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
6437-66173-0035 THE GENTLE SOUL HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE FENCE SUFFERING UNTOLD AGONY
6437-66173-0036 ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
6437-66173-0037 I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
6437-66173-0039 DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
6437-66173-0040 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0042 MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
6437-66173-0043 PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
6437-66173-0044 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0045 FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
6437-66173-0046 I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
6437-66173-0047 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0048 THEY'LL BE HANDY TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE SAYS MISS ABIGAIL GRIMLY OF COURSE SO GREAT A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE WAS NOT TO BE PASSED OVER BY MISTER GRIMSHAW
6437-66173-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0050 AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
6437-66173-0051 THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
6437-66173-0052 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
6437-66173-0053 I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
6437-66173-0054 I NOTICED THAT MISTER GRIMSHAW'S HAND UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF PERHAPS RESTED LIGHTLY FROM TIME TO TIME ON WALLACE'S SUNNY HAIR THE EXAMINATION FINISHED MISTER GRIMSHAW LEANED ON THE DESK THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
6437-66173-0055 EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
6437-66173-0056 I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
6437-66173-0057 IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
6437-66173-0058 BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
6437-66173-0059 I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
6437-66173-0060 WE CLASPED HANDS IN THE TAMEST MANNER IMAGINABLE AND CONWAY MUMBLED I'M SORRY I FOUGHT WITH YOU I THINK YOU ARE I REPLIED DRILY AND I'M SORRY I HAD TO THRASH YOU
6437-66173-0061 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
6437-66173-0062 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
