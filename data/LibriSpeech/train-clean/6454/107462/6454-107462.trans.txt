6454-107462-0000 PATRICK DEASEY DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A PHILOSOPHER PSYCHOLOGIST AND HUMORIST IT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE PATRICK DELIGHTED IN LONG WORDS AND PARTLY TO EXCUSE HIMSELF
6454-107462-0001 FOR BEING FULL OF THE SOUR CREAM OF AN INHUMAN CURIOSITY HIS CURIOSITY HOWEVER DID NOT EXTEND ITSELF TO SCIENCE
6454-107462-0002 AT FIRST WHEN DEASEY RETIRED FROM THE POLICE FORCE WITH A PENSION AND AN HEIRESS WITH THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND TIME HUNG HEAVY ON HIS HANDS HE WOULD TRY TO SATISFY THIS CRAVING THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A HOST OF SMALL
6454-107462-0003 FLIRTATIONS WITH EVERYBODY'S MAID IN THIS WAY HE COULD INFORM HIMSELF EXACTLY HOW MANY LOAVES WERE TAKEN BY THE SWEENEYS FOR A WEEK'S CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH THOSE WHICH WERE DEVOURED BY ALL THE CASSIDYS
6454-107462-0004 FOR WHOM THE BOTTLES AT THE PRESBYTERY WENT IN BY THE BACK DOOR AND WHAT WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE TWIN MISS MC INERNEYS BUT THESE WERE BUT BLACKBIRD SCRATCHINGS AS IT WERE
6454-107462-0005 UPON THE DEEP SOIL OF THE HUMAN HEART WHAT DEASEY CARED ABOUT WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE SECRETS OF THE SOUL NEVER MET A MAN HE WAS WONT TO SAY WITH NO BACKSTAIRS TO HIS MIND
6454-107462-0006 TO RING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF ORDINARY INTERCOURSE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR HIM WHEN DEASEY INVESTED HIS WIFE'S MONEY IN A PUBLIC HOUSE HE DEVELOPED A BETTER PLAN IT WAS THE PLAN WHICH MADE HIM ULTIMATELY DESCRIBE HIMSELF
6454-107462-0007 HE WOULD GENTLY CLOSE THE DOOR OF THE BAR PARLOUR PICK UP A TUMBLER BREATHE ON IT POLISH THE BREATH LEAN ONE ELBOW ON THE BAR LOOK ROUND HIM ONCE AGAIN
6454-107462-0008 AND SETTING THE WHISKY BOTTLE BETWIXT HIS CUSTOMER AND HIMSELF WITH A NOD WHICH SAID HELP YOURSELF HE WOULD LEAN FORWARD WITH THE SOFT INDULGENT GRIN OF THE HUMAN MAN OF THE WORLD AND BEGIN NOW
6454-107462-0009 BUT AS BETWEEN FRIEN'S CERTAIN DELICATE LITTLE FACTS IN YOUR PAST LIFE HAVE COME INADVERTENTLY TO ME HEARING SOMETIMES HE WOULD ALLUDE TO A CERTAIN DOCUMENT OR
6454-107462-0010 INCRIMINATING FACTS OR CERTAIN LETTERS HE WOULD RING THE CHANGES ON THESE THREE ACCORDING TO THE SEX AND TEMPERAMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL
6454-107462-0011 BUT ALWAYS WHATEVER THE WORDS WHATEVER THE NATURE OR SEX THE SHOT WOULD TELL FIRST CAME THE LITTLE START THE STRAIGHTENED FIGURE THE PALLOR OR FLUSH
6454-107462-0012 THE SHAMED AND SUDDENLY LIT EYES AND THEN WHO TOLD YOU MISTER DEASEY SIR OR WHERE DID YOU GET THE LETTER AH NOW THAT WOULD BE TELLING
6454-107462-0013 DEASEY WOULD MAKE REPLY BUT TWAS FROM A CERTAIN PERSON WHOM PERHAPS WE NEED NOT NAME THEN THE WHISKEY BOTTLE WOULD MOVE FORWARD LIKE A PAWN IN CHESS AND THE NEXT SOOTHING WORDS WOULD BE
6454-107462-0014 AND YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME FORTHWITH THE LITTLE SKELETON IN THAT MAN'S CUPBOARD WOULD LEAN FORWARD AND PRESS UPON THE DOOR UNTIL AT LAST THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A BONE OR TWO
6454-107462-0015 AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SKELETON WOULD RATTLE OUT UPON THE FLOOR HE HAD PLAYED THIS GAME SO OFTEN THAT ALMOST AT FIRST SIGHT HE COULD CLASSIFY HIS DUPES
6454-107462-0016 UNDER THE THREE HEADS INTO WHICH HE HAD DIVIDED THEM THOSE WHO DEMANDED WITH VIOLENT THREATS WHICH MELTED LIKE SNOW BEFORE THE SUNSHINE OF JOHN JAMIESON THE LETTER OR THE NAME OF THE INFORMANT
6454-107462-0017 THOSE WHO ASKED AFTER A GENTLE SIP OR TWO HOW THE LETTER HAD COME INTO HIS HANDS AND THOSE WHO ASKED IMMEDIATELY IF THE LETTER HADN'T BEEN DESTROYED AS A RULE FROM THE TYPE THAT DEMANDED THE LETTER BACK
6454-107462-0018 HE ONLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TIP OF THE SECRET'S EARS FROM THOSE THEY WERE NEARLY ALWAYS THE WOMEN WHO SWIFTLY ASKED IF HE HADN'T DESTROYED THE LETTERS HE CAUGHT SHAME FACED GLEAMS OF THE TRUTH
6454-107462-0019 BUT THOSE WHO ASKED BETWEEN PENSIVE SIPS HOW THE FACTS OR THE LETTER HAD COME HIS WAY THESE WERE THE ONES WHO YIELDED DEASEY THE RICHEST HARVEST OF RATTLING SKELETON BONES
6454-107462-0020 INDEED IT WAS CURIOUSLY INSTRUCTIVE HOW JOHN JAMIESON LAID DOWN A CAUSEWAY OF GLEAMING STEPPING STONES SO THAT DEASEY MIGHT CROSS LIGHTLY OVER THE TURGID WATERS OF HIS VICTIMS SOULS
6454-107462-0021 HAS BEEN INADVERTENTLY REVEALED TO ME BUT IS FOR EVER SACRED IN ME BREAST IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE HOW FROM THE UNDERWORLD OF THE MAN'S MIND THERE WOULD TRIP OUT THE COMPANY OF MISSHAPEN HOBGOBLINS
6454-107462-0022 AND GNOMES WHICH HAD BEEN LOCKED AWAY IN DARKNESS MAYBE THIS MANY A YEAR WELL HOW WOULD I GET THE TIME TO CLANE THE CHILDER AND TO WASH THEIR HEADS AND I WORKING ALL THE DAY AT CURING STINKIN HIDES
6454-107462-0023 AND HE FELL OVER ON THE SIDE AND BUSTED ALL HIS VEINS OR WELL AN WOULDN'T YOU DRAW TWO PINSIONS YOURSELF MISTER DEASEY IF YOU'D A WIFE WITH TWO HAN'S LIKE A SIEVE FOR YELLOW GOLD
6454-107462-0024 THERE WAS ONE OF THIS NATURE WHICH TROUBLED HIS REST LONG WELL THE WAY OF IT WAS YOU SEE HE PUT IT UP THE CHIMBLEY BUT WHEN THE CHIMBLEY SWEEPERS COME HE TRANSFERRED IT IN HIS WESKIT
6454-107462-0025 TO MY PLACE AND I DROPPED IT DOWN THE WELL THEY FOUND IT WHEN THEY LET THE BUCKET DOWN BUT I WASN'T HIS ACCOMPLICE AT ALL TWAS ONLY CONNIVANCE WITH ME WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF THE CHIMNEY AND THE WELL
6454-107462-0026 DEASEY CONCLUDED AT ONCE IT WAS A FOULLY MURDERED CORPSE BUT THEN AGAIN YOU COULD NOT WELL CONCEAL A CORPSE IN SOMEONE'S WAISTCOAT AND GOLD COINS WOULD MELT OR BE MISLAID AMONGST THE LOOSE BRICKS OF A SOOTY CHIMNEY
6454-107462-0027 DEASEY HAD CRAVED FOR CORPSES BUT NOTHING SO GRIM AS THAT HAD RISEN TO HIS WHISKY BAIT UNTIL HE TRIED THE SAME OLD GAME ON MISSUS GERAGHTY WHAT SUBTLE INSTINCT WAS IT THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO ADD
6454-107462-0028 TO THE FIRST UNVARYING WORDS BUT ALL THAT IS NOW PAST AND OVER AND SAFE BENEATH THE MOULDERING CLAY AT THESE LAST WORDS THE WIDOW GERAGHTY KNEW WELL THE BARRIER WAS DOWN
6454-107462-0029 THAT FENCES OFF ONE HUMAN SOUL FROM ANOTHER ALL THE SAME SHE SHOOK HER TREMBLING HEAD WHEN DEASEY DREW THE CORK AT HER REFUSAL DEASEY WAS STRUCK WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL COMPASSION

6454-107462-0033 AND THE BLACK BONNET ON THE HEAD OF HER AN ALL IT WAS THE ONLY LITTLE ONE SHE HAD WENT ON THE WIDOW BOWED ALMOST TO THE BAR BY SHAME AND IT ALWAYS PERCHED UP ON HER KNEE AND TAKING FOOD FROM HER MOUTH
