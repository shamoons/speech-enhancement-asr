6454-120342-0000 OURS ARE NOT THE CAROLLINGS OF YOUR POOR SHIVERING LITTLE EAST ANGLES OR SOUTH MERCIANS WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLOD ROUND AFOOT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE IS
6454-120342-0001 I HAD ASKED HARRY TO HAVE SIXTEEN OF THE BEST VOICES IN THE CHAPEL SCHOOL TO BE TRAINED TO EIGHT OR TEN GOOD CAROLS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY WE DID NOT CARE TO DISAPPOINT THEM IF A FEBRUARY THAW SETTING IN ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER
6454-120342-0002 SHOULD BREAK UP THE SPREE BEFORE IT BEGAN THEN I HAD TOLD HOWLAND THAT HE MUST RESERVE FOR ME A SPAN OF GOOD HORSES AND A SLEIGH THAT I COULD PACK SIXTEEN SMALL CHILDREN INTO TIGHT STOWED
6454-120342-0003 HOWLAND IS ALWAYS GOOD ABOUT SUCH THINGS KNEW WHAT THE SLEIGH WAS FOR HAVING DONE THE SAME IN OTHER YEARS AND DOUBLED THE SPAN OF HORSES OF HIS OWN ACCORD BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
6454-120342-0004 SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE WEATHER NYMPHS ORDERED THE WIND HAULED ROUND TO THE NORTHWEST AND EVERYTHING FROZE HARD MONDAY NIGHT THINGS MODERATED AND THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL STEADILY SO STEADILY
6454-120342-0005 AND SO TUESDAY NIGHT THE METROPOLITAN PEOPLE GAVE UP THEIR UNEQUAL CONTEST ALL GOOD MEN AND ANGELS REJOICING AT THEIR DISCOMFITURE AND ONLY A FEW OF THE PEOPLE IN THE VERY LOWEST BOLGIE BEING ILL NATURED ENOUGH TO GRIEVE
6454-120342-0006 AND WITHOUT FATIGUE TO HORSE OR MAN SO IT WAS THAT WHEN I CAME DOWN WITH LYCIDAS TO THE CHAPEL AT SEVEN O'CLOCK I FOUND HARRY HAD GATHERED THERE HIS EIGHT PRETTY GIRLS AND HIS EIGHT JOLLY BOYS
6454-120342-0007 AND HAD THEM PRACTISING FOR THE LAST TIME CAROL CAROL CHRISTIANS CAROL JOYFULLY CAROL FOR THE COMING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY I THINK THE CHILDREN HAD GOT INKLING OF WHAT WAS COMING
6454-120342-0008 OR PERHAPS HARRY HAD HINTED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS CERTAINLY THEY WERE WARMLY DRESSED AND WHEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS HOWLAND CAME ROUND HIMSELF WITH THE SLEIGH HE HAD PUT IN AS MANY RUGS AND BEAR SKINS
6454-120342-0009 AS IF HE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN WERE TO BE TAKEN NEW BORN FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE CRADLES GREAT WAS THE REJOICING AS THE BELLS OF THE HORSES RANG BENEATH THE CHAPEL WINDOWS AND HARRY DID NOT GET HIS LAST DA CAPO FOR HIS LAST CAROL
6454-120342-0010 UNDER THE FULL MOON ON THE SNOW STILL WHITE WITH SIXTEEN CHILDREN AT THE HAPPIEST
6454-120342-0011 THERE CAN BE NOTHING BETTER THAN TWO OR THREE SUCH HOURS FIRST DRIVER OUT ON COMMONWEALTH AVENUE THAT WILL TONE DOWN THE HORSES STOP ON THE LEFT AFTER YOU HAVE PASSED FAIRFIELD STREET
6454-120342-0012 SO WE DASHED UP TO THE FRONT OF HALIBURTON'S PALACE WHERE HE WAS KEEPING HIS FIRST CHRISTMAS TIDE AND THE CHILDREN WHOM HARRY HAD HUSHED DOWN FOR A SQUARE OR TWO BROKE FORTH WITH GOOD FULL VOICE UNDER HIS STRONG LEAD IN
6454-120342-0013 SHEPHERD OF TENDER SHEEP SINGING WITH ALL THAT UNCONSCIOUS PATHOS WITH WHICH CHILDREN DO SING AND STARTING THE TEARS IN YOUR EYES IN THE MIDST OF YOUR GLADNESS THE INSTANT THE HORSES BELLS STOPPED THEIR VOICES BEGAN
6454-120342-0014 IN AN INSTANT MORE WE SAW HALIBURTON AND ANNA RUN TO THE WINDOW AND PULL UP THE SHADES AND IN A MINUTE MORE FACES AT ALL THE WINDOWS AND SO THE CHILDREN SUNG THROUGH CLEMENT'S OLD HYMN
6454-120342-0015 LITTLE DID CLEMENT THINK OF BELLS AND SNOW AS HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL THERE IN ALEXANDRIA BUT PERHAPS TO DAY AS THEY PIN UP THE LAURELS AND THE PALM IN THE CHAPEL AT ALEXANDRIA
6454-120342-0016 THEY ARE HUMMING THE WORDS NOT THINKING OF CLEMENT MORE THAN HE THOUGHT OF US AS THE CHILDREN CLOSED WITH
6454-120342-0017 HALIBURTON CAME RUNNING OUT AND BEGGED ME TO BRING THEM IN BUT I TOLD HIM NO AS SOON AS I COULD HUSH THEIR SHOUTS OF MERRY CHRISTMAS THAT WE HAD A LONG JOURNEY BEFORE US AND MUST NOT ALIGHT BY THE WAY
6454-120342-0018 AND THE CHILDREN BROKE OUT WITH HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY RATHER A FAVORITE QUICKER AND MORE TO THE CHILDISH TASTE PERHAPS THAN THE OTHER AND WITH ANOTHER MERRY CHRISTMAS WE WERE OFF AGAIN
6454-120342-0019 WE RAN THE SLEIGH INTO A BANK ON THE SLOPE OF PINCKNEY STREET IN FRONT OF WALTER'S HOUSE AND BEFORE THEY SUSPECTED THERE THAT ANY ONE HAD COME THE CHILDREN WERE SINGING CAROL CAROL CHRISTIANS CAROL JOYFULLY
6454-120342-0020 KISSES FLUNG FROM THE WINDOW KISSES FLUNG BACK FROM THE STREET MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN WITH A GOOD WILL AND THEN ONE OF THE GIRLS BEGAN WHEN ANNA TOOK THE BABY AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HERS
6454-120342-0021 AND ALL OF THEM FELL IN SO CHEERILY O DEAR ME IT IS A SCRAP OF OLD EPHREM THE SYRIAN IF THEY DID BUT KNOW IT AND WHEN AFTER THIS HARRY WOULD FAIN HAVE DRIVEN ON
6454-120342-0022 BECAUSE TWO CAROLS AT ONE HOUSE WAS THE RULE HOW THE LITTLE WITCHES BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SING JUST ONE SONG MORE THERE BECAUSE MISSUS ALEXANDER HAD BEEN SO KIND TO THEM WHEN SHE SHOWED THEM ABOUT THE GERMAN STITCHES
6454-120342-0023 AND THEN UP THE HILL AND OVER TO THE NORTH END AND AS FAR AS WE COULD GET THE HORSES UP INTO MOON COURT THAT THEY MIGHT SING TO THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN WHO GAVE LUCY THE BOY AND DOG IN PLASTER
6454-120342-0024 THOUGH CHRYSOSTOM SHOULD HAVE MADE A FEW REMARKS TO THEM SEVENTEEN TIMES IN THE CHAPEL THEN THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE NOW IS THE TIME OF CHRISTMAS COME AND
6454-120342-0025 JESUS IN HIS BABES ABIDING AND THEN WE CAME UP HANOVER STREET AND STOPPED UNDER MISTER GERRY'S CHAPEL WHERE THEY WERE DRESSING THE WALLS WITH THEIR EVERGREENS AND GAVE THEM HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY
6454-120342-0026 AND SO DOWN STATE STREET AND STOPPED AT THE ADVERTISER OFFICE BECAUSE WHEN THE BOYS GAVE THEIR LITERARY ENTERTAINMENT MISTER HALE PUT IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT FOR NOTHING AND UP IN THE OLD ATTIC THERE
6454-120342-0027 AND THE IN GENERAL MAN FROM HIS MORE SERIOUS VIEWS AND THE DAILY THE NEXT MORNING WISHED EVERYBODY A MERRY CHRISTMAS WITH EVEN MORE UNCTION AND RESOLVED THAT IN COMING YEARS IT WOULD HAVE A SUPPLEMENT
6454-120342-0028 LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN ALL THE GOOD WISHES SO AWAY AGAIN TO THE HOUSES OF CONFECTIONERS WHO HAD GIVEN THE CHILDREN CANDY
6454-120342-0029 TO THE PALACES OF MILLIONNAIRES WHO HAD PRAYED FOR THESE CHILDREN WITH TEARS IF THE CHILDREN ONLY KNEW IT TO DOCTOR FROTHINGHAM'S IN SUMMER STREET I REMEMBER WHERE WE STOPPED BECAUSE THE BOSTON ASSOCIATION OF MINISTERS MET THERE
6454-120342-0030 AND OUT ON DOVER STREET BRIDGE THAT THE POOR CHAIR MENDER MIGHT HEAR OUR CAROLS SUNG ONCE MORE BEFORE HE HEARD THEM BETTER SUNG IN ANOTHER WORLD WHERE NOTHING NEEDS MENDING
6454-120342-0031 KING OF GLORY KING OF PEACE HEAR THE SONG AND SEE THE STAR WELCOME BE THOU HEAVENLY KING
6454-120342-0032 AND ALL THE OTHERS RUNG OUT WITH ORDER OR WITHOUT ORDER BREAKING THE HUSH DIRECTLY AS THE HORSES BELLS WERE STILLED THROWN INTO THE AIR WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF CHILDHOOD
6454-120342-0033 EVERYWHERE A LITTLE CROWD GATHERED ROUND US AND THEN WE DASHED AWAY FAR ENOUGH TO GATHER QUITE ANOTHER CROWD AND THEN BACK PERHAPS NOT SORRY TO DOUBLE ON OUR STEPS IF NEED WERE AND LEAVING EVERY CROWD WITH A HAPPY THOUGHT OF
6454-120342-0034 THE STAR THE MANGER AND THE CHILD AT NINE WE BROUGHT UP AT MY HOUSE D STREET THREE DOORS FROM THE CORNER AND THE CHILDREN PICKED THEIR VERY BEST FOR POLLY AND MY SIX LITTLE GIRLS TO HEAR
6454-120342-0035 BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT STAY TILL THE LAST MOMENT THEY COULD WALK BACK FROM THE STABLE AND RATHER WALK THAN NOT INDEED
