6454-93938-0000 WHAT SEEMED AT THE MOMENT AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE PUZZLE HAD AS WE AFTERWARDS LEARNED A VERY SIMPLE EXPLANATION ONE OF THE G S DIRECTORS MISTER BALDWIN WHO HAD COME IN ON MISTER CAMP'S CAR
6454-93938-0001 SEEING THROUGH THE DEVICE THE PARTY HAD AT ONCE GONE TO THIS RANCH WHERE THE OWNER BALDWIN MOUNTED THEM AND IT WAS THEIR DUST CLOUD WE HAD SEEN AS THEY RODE UP TO ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0002 TO MAKE MATTERS MORE SERIOUS BALDWIN HAD ROUNDED UP HIS COWBOYS AND BROUGHT THEM ALONG WITH HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE IMPOSSIBLE I MADE NO OBJECTION TO THE SHERIFF SERVING THE PAPER
6454-93938-0003 AND THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES ARE AGAINST SISERA WITH THE SHERIFF AND MISTER CAMP I THEN WALKED OVER TO THE SALOON WHERE JUDGE WILSON WAS WAITING TO DISPOSE OF MY CASE
6454-93938-0004 AND ANSWERED THAT I ASKED AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE CASE SO THAT I MIGHT BE HEARD BY COUNSEL IT WAS DENIED AS WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTED INDEED WHY THEY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH THE FORMS WAS BEYOND ME
6454-93938-0005 I TOLD WILSON I SHOULD NOT PRODUCE THE LETTERS AND HE ASKED IF I KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING AND RETORTING IT VERY APPROPRIATELY MEANS CONTEMPT OF THE COURT YOUR HONOR
6454-93938-0006 SEEING THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE MOVES TOO WELL TO BE BLUFFED THE JUDGE MISTER CAMP AND THE LAWYER HELD A WHISPERED CONSULTATION MY SURPRISE CAN BE IMAGINED WHEN AT ITS CONCLUSION MISTER CAMP SAID
6454-93938-0007 ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER FOURTEENTH AND ASK THAT HE BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON THAT CHARGE I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THIS NEW MOVE AND PUZZLED OVER IT WHILE JUDGE WILSON ORDERED MY COMMITMENT
6454-93938-0008 BUT THE NEXT STEP REVEALED THE OBJECT FOR THE LAWYER THEN ASKED FOR A SEARCH WARRANT TO LOOK FOR STOLEN PROPERTY THE JUDGE WAS EQUALLY OBLIGING AND BEGAN TO FILL ONE OUT ON THE INSTANT
6454-93938-0009 THIS MADE ME FEEL PRETTY SERIOUS FOR THE LETTERS WERE IN MY BREAST POCKET AND I SWORE AT MY OWN STUPIDITY IN NOT HAVING PUT THEM IN THE STATION SAFE WHEN I HAD FIRST ARRIVED AT ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0010 THERE WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS IN WHICH TO THINK WHILE THE JUDGE SCRIBBLED AWAY AT THE WARRANT BUT IN WHAT TIME THERE WAS I DID A LOT OF HEAD WORK WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING MORE THAN ONE WAY OUT OF THE SNARL
6454-93938-0011 AND WHEN I SAW THE JUDGE FINISH OFF HIS SIGNATURE WITH A FLOURISH I PLAYED A PRETTY DESPERATE CARD YOU'RE JUST TOO LATE GENTLEMEN I SAID POINTING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE SALOON THERE COME THE CAVALRY
6454-93938-0012 THE THREE CONSPIRATORS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND BOLTED FOR THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0013 AS HE DID SO I GAVE HIM A SHOVE TOWARDS THE THREE WHICH SENT THEM ALL SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR IN A PRETTY BADLY MIXED UP CONDITION I MADE A DASH FOR THE DOOR AND AS I WENT THROUGH IT
6454-93938-0014 I GRABBED THE KEY AND LOCKED THEM IN WHEN I TURNED TO DO SO I SAW THE LOT STRUGGLING UP FROM THE FLOOR AND KNOWING THAT IT WOULDN'T TAKE THEM MANY SECONDS TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0015 AS ONLY WESTERN HORSES WILL STAND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO HAVE THOSE BRIDLES BACK IN PLACE AND AS I TOSSED EACH OVER THE PEAK OF THE MEXICAN SADDLE
6454-93938-0016 I GAVE TWO OF THE PONIES SLAPS WHICH STARTED THEM OFF AT A LOPE ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS I SWUNG MYSELF INTO THE SADDLE OF THE THIRD AND FLICKED HIM WITH THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE BRIDLE IN A WAY WHICH MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I MEANT BUSINESS
6454-93938-0017 AND CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD COVERED OVER FORTY MILES THAT AFTERNOON IN PRETTY QUICK TIME IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH GO LEFT IN HIM
6454-93938-0018 TWO HUNDRED FEET THEREFORE BROUGHT ME TO THE EDGE OF THE TOWN AND I WHEELED MY PONY AND RODE DOWN BEHIND THE REAR OF THE BUILDINGS IN TURNING I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HALF A DOZEN MOUNTED MEN ALREADY IN PURSUIT
6454-93938-0019 BUT I LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE NEXT MOMENT AS SOON AS I REACHED A STREET LEADING BACK TO THE RAILROAD I TURNED AGAIN AND RODE TOWARDS IT MY ONE THOUGHT BEING TO GET BACK IF POSSIBLE TO THE STATION
6454-93938-0020 AND PUT THE LETTERS INTO THE RAILROAD AGENT'S SAFE WHEN I REACHED THE MAIN STREET I SAW THAT MY HOPE WAS FUTILE FOR ANOTHER BATCH OF COWBOYS WERE COMING IN FULL GALLOP TOWARDS ME VERY THOROUGHLY HEADING ME OFF IN THAT DIRECTION
6454-93938-0021 TO ESCAPE THEM I HEADED UP THE STREET AWAY FROM THE STATION WITH THE PACK IN CLOSE PURSUIT THEY YELLED AT ME TO HOLD UP AND I EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO HEAR THE CRACK OF REVOLVERS
6454-93938-0022 IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING THE SHOOTING BEGIN AND TO KNOW THAT ANY MOMENT MAY BE YOUR LAST I DON'T SUPPOSE I WAS ON THE RAGGED EDGE MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS BUT THEY WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE TO ME THAT
6454-93938-0023 TO KEEP ONE'S BACK TURNED TO AN ENEMY AS ONE RUNS AWAY TAKES A DEAL MORE PLUCK THAN TO STAND UP AND FACE HIS GUN FORTUNATELY FOR ME MY PURSUERS FELT SO SURE OF MY CAPTURE
6454-93938-0024 THAT NOT ONE OF THEM DREW A BEAD ON ME THE MOMENT I SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE I PUT MY HAND IN MY BREAST POCKET AND TOOK OUT THE LETTERS INTENDING TO TEAR THEM INTO A HUNDRED PIECES BUT
6454-93938-0025 AS I DID SO I REALIZED THAT TO DESTROY UNITED STATES MAIL NOT MERELY ENTAILED CRIMINAL LIABILITY BUT WAS OFF COLOR MORALLY I FALTERED
6454-93938-0026 BALANCING THE OUTWITTING OF CAMP AGAINST STATE'S PRISON THE DOING MY BEST FOR MADGE AGAINST THE WRONG OF IT I THINK I'M AS HONEST A FELLOW AS THE AVERAGE BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I COULDN'T DECIDE TO DO RIGHT
6454-93938-0027 TILL I THOUGHT THAT MADGE WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE DISHONEST EVEN FOR HER I TURNED ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND CUT IN BEHIND SOME FREIGHT CARS THAT WERE STANDING ON A SIDING
6454-93938-0028 THIS PUT ME OUT OF VIEW OF MY PURSUERS FOR A MOMENT AND IN THAT INSTANT I STOOD UP IN MY STIRRUPS LIFTED THE BROAD LEATHER FLAP OF THE SADDLE AND TUCKED THE LETTERS UNDERNEATH IT AS FAR IN AS I COULD FORCE THEM
6454-93938-0029 IT WAS A DESPERATE PLACE IN WHICH TO HIDE THEM BUT THE GAME WAS A DESPERATE ONE AT BEST AND THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE IDEA MIGHT BE ITS BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS
6454-93938-0030 I WAS NOW HEADING FOR THE STATION OVER THE TIES AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE FRED CULLEN WITH LORD RALLES ON THE TRACKS UP BY THE SPECIAL FOR MY MIND HAD BEEN SO BUSY IN THE LAST HOUR
6454-93938-0031 THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT FRED WAS DUE THE MOMENT I SAW HIM I RODE TOWARDS HIM PRESSING MY PONY FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH MY HOPE WAS THAT I MIGHT GET TIME TO GIVE FRED THE TIP AS TO WHERE THE LETTERS WERE
6454-93938-0032 BUT BEFORE I WAS WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE BALDWIN CAME RUNNING OUT FROM BEHIND THE STATION AND SEEING ME TURNED CALLED BACK AND GESTICULATED EVIDENTLY TO SUMMON SOME COWBOYS TO HEAD ME OFF
6454-93938-0033 AFRAID TO SHOUT ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD CONVEY THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE LETTERS AS THE NEXT BEST THING I PULLED A COUPLE OF OLD SECTION REPORTS FROM MY POCKET
6454-93938-0034 INTENDING TO RIDE UP AND RUN INTO MY CAR FOR I KNEW THAT THE PAPERS IN MY HAND WOULD BE TAKEN TO BE THE WANTED LETTERS AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY GET INSIDE THE CAR EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE SUSPICION WOULD BE THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIDE THEM
6454-93938-0035 HIDE THEM FRED WAS QUICK AS A FLASH AND GRABBING THEM OFF THE GROUND SPRANG UP THE STEPS OF MY CAR AND RAN INSIDE JUST ESCAPING A BULLET FROM MY PURSUERS
