6531-61334-0000 THE SLEEPERS OPEN THEIR EYES AND RAISE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ELBOWS THEN THE SHEPHERD HEARS A WARNING VOICE WHICH COMES AND GOES LIKE THE WIND SAYING IF THE HORN IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD WILL BE UPSET ALTOGETHER
6531-61334-0001 TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
6531-61334-0002 SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
6531-61334-0003 THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES HAD GROWN ONCE AGAIN POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS BUT NO GREAT LEADER LIKE SUBBILULIUMA AROSE TO WELD THE VARIOUS STATES INTO AN EMPIRE
6531-61334-0004 SO AS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE MINGLED PEOPLES FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS WAR LORDS OF ASSYRIA ONE KINGDOM HAD ITS CAPITAL AT HAMATH AND ANOTHER AT CARCHEMISH ON THE EUPHRATES THE KINGDOM OF TABAL FLOURISHED IN CILICIA KHILAKKU
6531-61334-0005 IT INCLUDED SEVERAL CITY STATES LIKE TARSUS TIANA AND COMANA KAMMANU FARTHER WEST WAS THE DOMINION OF THE THRACO PHRYGIAN MUSKI THE TRIBES ROUND THE SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0006 HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0007 THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ASSYRIA WAS CONTINUALLY MENACED BY GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT HILL STATES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE HAD THEY OPERATED TOGETHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY BUT WERE LIABLE TO BE EXTINGUISHED WHEN ATTACKED IN DETAIL
6531-61334-0008 A NUMBER OF ARAMAEAN KINGDOMS HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THROUGHOUT SYRIA
6531-61334-0009 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0010 GROUPS OF THE ARAMAEANS HAD ACQUIRED A HIGH DEGREE OF CULTURE AND BECOME TRADERS AND ARTISANS
6531-61334-0011 ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
6531-61334-0012 THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0013 OPERATED IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0014 IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
6531-61334-0015 A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0016 INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES
6531-61334-0017 NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
6531-61334-0018 IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0019 LIKE HIS FATHER ASHUR NATSIR PAL FOUGHT AGAINST THE MUSKI WHOSE POWER WAS DECLINING THEN HE TURNED SOUTHWARD FROM THE BORDERS OF ASIA MINOR AND DEALT WITH A REBELLION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AN ARAMAEAN PRETENDER NAMED AKHIABABA
6531-61334-0020 HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AT SURU IN THE REGION TO THE EAST OF THE EUPHRATES ENCLOSED BY ITS TRIBUTARIES THE KHABAR AND THE BALIKH HE HAD COME FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ARAMAEAN STATE OF BIT ADINI AND WAS PREPARING IT WOULD APPEAR
6531-61334-0021 TO FORM A POWERFUL CONFEDERACY AGAINST THE ASSYRIANS WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL APPROACHED SURU A PART OF ITS POPULATION WELCOMED HIM HE ENTERED THE CITY SEIZED THE PRETENDER AND MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
6531-61334-0022 THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
6531-61334-0023 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN FLAYED THEIR SKINS WERE NAILED UPON THE CITY WALLS ANOTHER REVOLT BROKE OUT IN THE KIRKHI DISTRICT BETWEEN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TIGRIS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0024 IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE NAIRI TRIBES AND EVEN SUPPORTED BY SOME ASSYRIAN OFFICIALS TERRIBLE REPRISALS WERE METED OUT TO THE REBELS WHEN THE CITY OF KINABU WAS CAPTURED NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS WERE BURNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0025 THE UNFAITHFUL GOVERNOR BEING FLAYED THE CITY OF DAMDAMUSA WAS SET ON FIRE THEN TELA WAS ATTACKED ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS RUNS AS FOLLOWS
6531-61334-0026 THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG

6531-61334-0028 MANY CAPTIVES I BURNED WITH FIRE MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS I TOOK ALIVE OF SOME I CUT OFF HANDS AND LIMBS OF OTHERS THE NOSES EARS AND ARMS OF MANY SOLDIERS I PUT OUT THE EYES
6531-61334-0029 I REARED A COLUMN OF THE LIVING AND A COLUMN OF HEADS I HUNG ON HIGH THEIR HEADS ON TREES IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR CITY THEIR BOYS AND GIRLS I BURNED UP IN FLAMES I DEVASTATED THE CITY DUG IT UP IN FIRE BURNED IT
6531-61334-0030 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0031 FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE GREAT CONQUEROR ENGAGED HIMSELF IN THUS SUBDUING REBELLIOUS TRIBES AND EXTENDING HIS TERRITORY HIS MILITARY HEADQUARTERS WERE AT KALKHI TO WHICH CITY THE COURT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED
6531-61334-0032 THITHER HE DRAFTED THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM HE INCORPORATED IN THE ASSYRIAN ARMY ASSYRIAN COLONIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS FOR STRATEGICAL PURPOSES AND OFFICIALS SUPPLANTED THE PETTY KINGS IN CERTAIN OF THE NORTHERN CITY STATES
6531-61334-0033 THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA GAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO ASHUR NATSIR PAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD LAID A HEAVY HAND ON SURU THE SOUTHERN TRIBES THE SUKHI STIRRED UP REVOLTS IN MESOPOTAMIA AS THE ALLIES OF THE BABYLONIANS
6531-61334-0034 ON ONE OCCASION ASHUR NATSIR PAL SWEPT SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION AND ATTACKED A COMBINED FORCE OF SUKHI ARAMAEANS AND BABYLONIANS THE BABYLONIANS WERE COMMANDED BY ZABDANU
6531-61334-0035 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE WESTERN TRADE ROUTE THE ASSYRIAN WAR LORD HOWEVER PROVED TO BE TOO POWERFUL A RIVAL HE ACHIEVED SO COMPLETE A VICTORY
6531-61334-0036 THE PEOPLE OF KASHSHI BABYLONIA AND KALDU CHALDAEA WERE STRICKEN WITH TERROR AND HAD TO AGREE TO PAY INCREASED TRIBUTE
6531-61334-0037 REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
6531-61334-0038 HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
6531-61334-0039 HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES TRIBUTE POURED IN FROM THE SUBJECT STATES THE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TRIBES IN THE NORTH FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE WINE AND CORN
6531-61334-0040 SHEEP AND CATTLE AND HORSES AND FROM THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES CAME MUCH SILVER AND GOLD COPPER AND LEAD JEWELS AND IVORY AS WELL AS RICHLY DECORATED FURNITURE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS
6531-61334-0041 ARTISTS AND ARTISANS WERE ALSO PROVIDED BY THE VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THERE ARE TRACES OF PHOENICIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ART OF THIS PERIOD ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S GREAT PALACE AT KALKHI WAS EXCAVATED BY LAYARD
6531-61334-0042 WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
6531-61334-0043 IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LABOUR OF THE DAY I OFTEN SAT AT THE DOOR OF MY TENT GIVING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THAT CALM AND REPOSE WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO THE SENSES BY SUCH SCENES AS THESE
6531-61334-0044 AS THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE LOW HILLS WHICH SEPARATE THE RIVER FROM THE DESERT EVEN THEIR ROCKY SIDES HAD STRUGGLED TO EMULATE THE VERDANT CLOTHING OF THE PLAIN ITS RECEDING RAYS WERE GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN
6531-61334-0045 LIKE A TRANSPARENT VEIL OF LIGHT FROM THE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PURE CLOUDLESS SKY WAS THE GLOW OF THE LAST LIGHT
6531-61334-0046 KESHAF ANOTHER VENERABLE RUIN ROSE INDISTINCTLY INTO THE EVENING MIST STILL MORE DISTANT AND STILL MORE INDISTINCT WAS A SOLITARY HILL OVERLOOKING THE ANCIENT CITY OF ARBELA
6531-61334-0047 THE KURDISH MOUNTAINS WHOSE SNOWY SUMMITS CHERISHED THE DYING SUNBEAMS YET STRUGGLED WITH THE TWILIGHT THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND LOWING OF CATTLE
6531-61334-0048 AT FIRST FAINT BECAME LOUDER AS THE FLOCKS RETURNED FROM THEIR PASTURES AND WANDERED AMONGST THE TENTS GIRLS HURRIED OVER THE GREENSWARD TO SEEK THEIR FATHERS CATTLE OR CROUCHED DOWN TO MILK THOSE WHICH HAD RETURNED ALONE TO THEIR WELL REMEMBERED FOLDS
6531-61334-0049 BALES OF EMBROIDERED CLOTH IVORY AND JEWELS SILVER AND GOLD THE PRODUCTS OF MANY COUNTRIES WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE TO REAR STATELY BUILDINGS WHICH ULTIMATELY FELL INTO DECAY AND WERE BURIED BY DRIFTING SANDS
6531-61334-0050 LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
6531-61334-0051 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0052 THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
6531-61334-0053 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL DIED
6531-61334-0054 WHOSE MILITARY ACTIVITIES EXTENDED OVER HIS WHOLE REIGN
6531-61334-0055 AS SHALMANESER WAS THE FIRST ASSYRIAN KING WHO CAME INTO DIRECT TOUCH WITH THE HEBREWS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST HERE TO REVIEW THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH AS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE
6531-61334-0056 ESTABLISHED THE RELIGION OF THE CANAANITES AND MADE GODS AND MOLTEN IMAGES HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR HIS IDOLATRY BY THE PROPHET AHIJAH WHO DECLARED THE LORD SHALL SMITE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER
6531-61334-0057 AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
6531-61334-0058 AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
6531-61334-0059 AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
6531-61334-0060 AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID
6531-61334-0061 IN HIS DAYS THE LAND WAS QUIET TEN YEARS
6531-61334-0062 FOR HE TOOK AWAY THE ALTARS OF THE STRANGE GODS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BRAKE DOWN THE IMAGES AND CUT DOWN THE GROVES AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO DO THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT
6531-61334-0063 ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
6531-61334-0064 HE PROCEEDED TO FORTIFY RAMAH A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM
6531-61334-0065 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0066 AND THEREFORE UNABLE EITHER TO ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY IN JUDAH
6531-61334-0067 IN THE HOUR OF PERIL JUDAH SOUGHT THE AID OF THE KING OF DAMASCUS
6531-61334-0068 AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
6531-61334-0069 THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
6531-61334-0070 WHEN HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS SERVANT ZIMRI CAPTAIN OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE IN TIRZAH
6531-61334-0071 ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
6531-61334-0072 ZIMRI HATH CONSPIRED AND HATH ALSO SLAIN THE KING WHEREFORE ALL ISRAEL MADE OMRI THE CAPTAIN OF THE HOST KING OVER ISRAEL THAT DAY IN THE CAMP AND OMRI WENT UP FROM GIBBETHON AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM
6531-61334-0073 AND AHAB DID EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ABOVE ALL THAT WERE BEFORE HIM SO NOTORIOUS INDEED WERE FATHER AND SON THAT THE PROPHET MICAH DECLARED TO THE BACKSLIDERS OF HIS DAY FOR THE STATUTES OF OMRI ARE KEPT
6531-61334-0074 AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND YE WALK IN THEIR COUNSEL
6531-61334-0075 BOAST HIMSELF AS HE THAT PUTTETH IT OFF
6531-61334-0076 TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI
6531-61334-0077 THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES THEREAFTER THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH TURNED TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND ATTACKED THE HITTITE STATE OF HAMATH
6531-61334-0078 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0079 IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0080 OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU
6531-61334-0081 THE LATTER HAD A FORCE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND FOUR YEARS AFTER AHAB BEGAN TO REIGN
6531-61334-0082 HE TURNED NOT ASIDE FROM IT DOING THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD NEVERTHELESS THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY
6531-61334-0083 DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084 AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0085 SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
6531-61334-0086 OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0087 WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
6531-61334-0088 WAS SUPPORTED BY AN ARAMAEAN ARMY WAS DEFEATED AND PUT TO DEATH
6531-61334-0089 AFTERWARDS REIGNED OVER BABYLONIA AS THE VASSAL OF ASSYRIA AND SHALMANESER HIS OVERLORD MADE OFFERINGS TO THE GODS AT BABYLON BORSIPPA AND CUTHAH
6531-61334-0090 AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0091 HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RETURN WITH A GREAT ARMY BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ANY PERMANENT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIS ENEMIES TO FLIGHT THE VARIOUS WESTERN KINGDOMS INCLUDING DAMASCUS ISRAEL
6531-61334-0092 REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES
6531-61334-0093 A ROYAL PRINCESS OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD
6531-61334-0094 THUS SAITH THE LORD I HAVE ANOINTED THEE KING OVER ISRAEL AND THOU SHALT SMITE THE HOUSE OF AHAB THY MASTER THAT I MAY AVENGE THE BLOOD OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND THE BLOOD OF ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD
6531-61334-0095 JEHU CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ESCORT
6531-61334-0096 SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
6531-61334-0097 AND INFORMED JORAM WHO TWICE SENT OUT A MESSENGER TO ENQUIRE IS IT PEACE NEITHER MESSENGER RETURNED AND THE WATCHMAN INFORMED THE WOUNDED MONARCH OF ISRAEL HE CAME EVEN UNTO THEM AND COMETH NOT AGAIN
6531-61334-0098 AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0099 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
6531-61334-0100 I FOUGHT WITH HIM SHALMANESER RECORDED AND ACCOMPLISHED HIS DEFEAT
6531-61334-0101 HE FLED TO SAVE HIS LIFE HAZAEL TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE WALLS OF DAMASCUS WHICH THE ASSYRIANS BESIEGED BUT FAILED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE SHALMANESER'S SOLDIERS MEANWHILE WASTED AND BURNED CITIES WITHOUT NUMBER
6531-61334-0102 AND CARRIED AWAY GREAT BOOTY IN THOSE DAYS SHALMANESER RECORDED I RECEIVED TRIBUTE FROM THE TYRIANS AND SIDONIANS AND FROM YAUA JEHU
6531-61334-0103 SHOWS THAT THE UNPRONOUNCED ALEPH AT THE END WAS AT THAT TIME SOUNDED
6531-61334-0104 JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0105 HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
6531-61334-0106 FOR ALTHOUGH HE STAMPED OUT THE PHOENICIAN RELIGION HE BEGAN TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND THAT WERE IN DAN
6531-61334-0107 OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0108 BUT ANOTHER WOMAN THWARTED THE COMPLETION OF HER MONSTROUS DESIGN
6531-61334-0109 THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING
6531-61334-0110 SHE CAME TO THE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE KING STOOD AT HIS PILLAR AT THE ENTERING IN AND THE PRINCES AND THE TRUMPETS BY THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND SOUNDED WITH TRUMPETS
6531-61334-0111 ALSO THE SINGERS WITH INSTRUMENTS OF MUSICK AND SUCH AS TAUGHT TO SING PRAISE
6531-61334-0112 AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
6531-61334-0113 HAVE HER FORTH OF THE RANGES AND WHOSO FOLLOWETH HER LET HIM BE SLAIN BY THE SWORD FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER
6531-61334-0114 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0115 AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED HE BESOUGHT THE LORD AND THE LORD HEARKENED UNTO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL
6531-61334-0116 AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
6531-61334-0117 TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
6531-61334-0118 LIKE THE FRONTIER TRIBES OF INDIA AGAINST THE BRITISH TROOPS THE KINGDOM OF URARTU WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL
6531-61334-0119 THE GREAT EMPIRE WAS SUDDENLY SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS BY THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR THE PARTY OF REBELLION WAS LED BY SHALMANESER'S SON ASHUR DANIN APLI
6531-61334-0120 HE WAS A POPULAR HERO AND RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASSYRIAN CITIES INCLUDING NINEVEH
6531-61334-0121 ARBELA IMGURBEL AND DUR BALAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DEPENDENCIES SHALMANESER RETAINED KALKHI AND THE PROVINCES OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY ALSO REMAINED LOYAL TO HIM
6531-61334-0122 AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
6531-61334-0123 WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0124 URARTU IN THE NORTH HAD GROWN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SYRIANS WERE OPENLY DEFIANT THE MEDES WERE CONDUCTING BOLD RAIDS
6531-61334-0125 SHAMSHI ADAD HOWEVER
6531-61334-0126 BURNED MANY CITIES AND COLLECTED ENORMOUS TRIBUTE WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND FORCED TO SERVE THE CONQUEROR HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS POWER IN THE NORTH SHAMSHI ADAD
6531-61334-0127 ON HIS WAY SOUTHWARD HE SUBDUED MANY VILLAGES
6531-61334-0128 AND ACHIEVED A GREAT VICTORY KILLING THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND TAKING THREE THOUSAND CAPTIVES THEN THE BABYLONIAN KING
6531-61334-0129 BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
6531-61334-0130 TWO HUNDRED HORSEMEN AND ONE HUNDRED CHARIOTS SHAMSHI ADAD CONDUCTED IN ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS IN BABYLONIA AND CHALDAEA WHICH HE COMPLETELY SUBDUED PENETRATING AS FAR AS THE SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF
6531-61334-0131 IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
6531-61334-0132 FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
