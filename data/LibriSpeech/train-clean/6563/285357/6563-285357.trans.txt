6563-285357-0000 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0001 ACCIDENTS WERE OF ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE DEFECTS WERE REVEALED HERE AND WEAKNESSES SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SOON AS ONE TROUBLE WAS OVERCOME ANOTHER MADE ITSELF MANIFEST THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIS HARD WORK
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0003 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0004 AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
6563-285357-0005 HAVING AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO EIGHTY FIVE HORSE POWER MOTORS DRIVING FOUR PROPELLERS AND DISPLACED NINE TONS ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE PREVIOUS CRAFT
6563-285357-0006 HAD BEEN ELIMINATED WHILE THE SHIP FOLLOWED IMPROVED LINES IN ITS MECHANICAL AND STRUCTURAL DETAILS THE TRIALS WITH THIS VESSEL COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN O FIVE BUT ILL LUCK HAD NOT BEEN ELUDED
6563-285357-0007 THE AIRSHIP WAS MOORED UPON A RAFT WHICH WAS TO BE TOWED OUT INTO THE LAKE TO ENABLE THE DIRIGIBLE TO ASCEND BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS A STRONG WIND CAUGHT THE UNGAINLY AIRSHIP SHE DIPPED HER NOSE INTO THE WATER AND AS THE MOTOR WAS SET GOING
6563-285357-0008 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0010 AND SHE WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED TO INDISTINGUISHABLE SCRAP DESPITE CATASTROPHE THE INVENTOR WRESTLED GAMELY WITH HIS PROJECT THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ONE DISASTER WERE TAKEN TO HEART
6563-285357-0011 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0012 WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
6563-285357-0013 WHO HAD NOW TAKEN COUNT ZEPPELIN UNDER HIS WING A STATE LOTTERY WAS INAUGURATED THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE HANDED OVER TO THE INDEFATIGABLE INVENTOR TOGETHER WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT IF HE COULD KEEP ALOFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT COMING TO EARTH IN THE MEANTIME
6563-285357-0014 AND COULD COVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WITHIN THIS PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REPAY THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY HE HAD LAVISHED UPON HIS IDEA AND LIQUIDATE ALL THE DEBTS HE HAD INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ANOTHER CRAFT WAS BUILT LARGER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS
6563-285357-0015 AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
6563-285357-0016 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0017 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0018 THE VESSEL ASCENDED AND TRAVELLED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR EIGHT HOURS THEN A SLIGHT MISHAP DEMANDED ATTENTION BUT WAS SPEEDILY REPAIRED AND WAS IGNORED OFFICIALLY AS BEING TOO TRIVIAL TO INFLUENCE THE MAIN ISSUE VICTORY APPEARED WITHIN
6563-285357-0019 MEASURABLE DISTANCE THE ARDUOUS TOIL OF MANY PATIENT YEARS WAS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED THE AIRSHIP WAS WITHIN SIGHT OF HOME WHEN IT HAD TO DESCEND OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER MOTOR FAULT BUT AS IT APPROACHED THE GROUND NATURE
6563-285357-0020 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0022 WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INCLUDING TWO UNAVOIDABLE DESCENTS STRUCK THE TEUTON IMAGINATION THE SEEDS SO CAREFULLY PLANTED BY THE MOST HIGH OF PRUSSIA NOW BORE FRUIT THE GERMAN NATION SYMPATHISED WITH THE INDOMITABLE INVENTOR
6563-285357-0023 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0025 HE COULD FORGE AHEAD UNTRAMMELLED BY ANXIETY AND WORRY ANOTHER ZEPPELIN WAS BUILT AND IT CREATED A WORLD'S RECORD IT REMAINED ALOFT FOR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT COVERED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND ALTHOUGH IT CAME TO GRIEF UPON ALIGHTING
6563-285357-0026 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0027 IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
6563-285357-0028 A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
6563-285357-0029 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0031 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-285357-0032 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0033 THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT THE TEUTONIC NATION HAS BEEN INDUCED TO PIN ITS WHOLE FAITH ON THIS AIRSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE MORE LEVELHEADED ENGINEERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CRAFT TO BE A MECHANICAL MONSTROSITY CONDEMNED FROM ITS DESIGN
6563-285357-0034 AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION TO DISASTER UNSHAKEN BY THIS ADVERSE CRITICISM GERMANY RESTS ASSURED THAT BY MEANS OF ITS ZEPPELINS IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY WHICH IT IS CONVINCED IS ITS DESTINY
6563-285357-0035 THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
6563-285357-0036 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0037 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0038 EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
6563-285357-0039 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0040 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN IS THE MAIN STAKE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO AERIAL CONQUEST OTHER TYPES OF AIRSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN IGNORED AS RELATED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOSTERED UPON A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SCALE
6563-285357-0041 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0042 SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
6563-285357-0043 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THOSE OF THE EARLY FRENCH SUPPLE AIRSHIPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER CRAFT WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RECOGNISED BY THE GERMAN NATION AS SUBSTANTIAL UNITS OF WAR SUCH AS THE RUTHEMBERG SIEMENS SCHUKERT AND SO FORTH
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
