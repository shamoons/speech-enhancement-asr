6818-68772-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM W P L AND THE WORDS
6818-68772-0001 FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE CERTAIN EDIBLES SUCH AS CHARLOTTE RUSSE SPANISH CREAM WINE JELLIES AND MOUSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CAVIARS AND ANCHOVIES WERE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THEM
6818-68772-0002 BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST
6818-68772-0003 WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COPE WITH SUCH A THRONG HE ALLOWED LOUISE TO IMPRESS SEVERAL FARMERS DAUGHTERS INTO SERVICE AND WAS ABLE TO FEED EVERYONE WITHOUT DELAY AND IN AN ABUNDANT AND SATISFACTORY MANNER
6818-68772-0004 AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG
6818-68772-0005 THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
6818-68772-0006 WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS
6818-68772-0007 THEY HAD CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO MORE PROMINENT PLACES UNTIL THE BARNS AND SHEDS AND THE VERY ROCKS WERE DAUBED WITH GLARING LETTERS ASKING US TO BUY THE MEDICINES SOAPS TOBACCOS AND OTHER WARES THE MANUFACTURERS WERE ANXIOUS TO SELL
6818-68772-0008 EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
6818-68772-0009 WHEN MISTER FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
6818-68772-0010 SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
6818-68772-0011 WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL EVER CARE TO ALLOW ADVERTISING SIGNS ON YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN AND THAT THE QUIET REFINEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL INDUCE MANY OTHER PLACES TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE
6818-68772-0012 UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
6818-68772-0013 HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT
6818-68772-0014 IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
6818-68772-0015 MISTER FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
6818-68772-0016 THEY NEEDED MORE SCHOOL HOUSES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH HE HOPED TO PROVIDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE DURING THIS ORATION BETH HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AT THE HOUSE AND HER SHARP EYES DETECTED THE MAID ELIZA
6818-68772-0017 STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
6818-68772-0018 HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENOUNCE THE MAID AT ONCE AND HAVE HER DISCHARGED BUT THE TIME WAS NOT OPPORTUNE SO SHE WAITED UNTIL THE FESTIVITIES WERE ENDED
6818-68772-0019 IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THEY DROVE HOMEWARD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE ROYAL MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED AND ADMIRATION FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAD PROVIDED THE FUN AND FEASTING
6818-68772-0020 INDEED THERE WERE MORE KINDLY THOUGHTS EXPRESSED FOR THE INHABITANTS OF ELMHURST THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTY AND THE GREAT AND THE HUMBLE SEEMED MORE CLOSELY DRAWN TOGETHER
6818-68772-0021 WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
6818-68772-0022 BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM
6818-68772-0023 AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
6818-68772-0024 I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
6818-68772-0025 I'D LIKE TO STUDY HER A LITTLE IT WAS ABSURD TO CONNECT HER WITH LUCY ROGERS OBSERVED KENNETH FOR THERE IS NOTHING IN HER CHARACTER TO REMIND ONE OF THE UNHAPPY GIRL EXCEPT HER LOOKS ADDED BETH SHE'S THE LIVING IMAGE OF MISSUS ROGERS
6818-68772-0026 THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MISSUS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH BUT ANYHOW
6818-68772-0027 I HAVE A WISH TO KEEP THIS GIRL AT THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN STUDY HER CHARACTER THEN KEEP HER MY DEAR DECIDED KENNETH I'LL SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO WATCH THE GATES AND IF SHE GOES OUT WE'LL KNOW WHOM SHE MEETS
6818-68772-0028 THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS TO REPORT OUR MOVEMENTS TO MISTER HOPKINS AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM IN THAT SO THE MATTER WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME AND AS IF TO VERIFY BETH'S SUSPICIONS ELIZA WAS SEEN TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS AFTER DUSK
6818-68772-0029 AND MEET MISTER HOPKINS IN THE LANE THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM THE NEXT DAY MISTER HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT
6818-68772-0030 THEY READ HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS
6818-68772-0031 BY DEPRIVING THEM OF THE INCOME DERIVED BY SELLING SPACES FOR ADVERTISING SIGNS HE IS ROBBING THE FARMERS WHILE CLAIMING HE WANTS TO BEAUTIFY THEIR HOMES
6818-68772-0032 THEREFORE THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE THEN FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATE OF THE MONEY PAID THE FARMERS OF THE DISTRICT BY THE ADVERTISERS DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS
6818-68772-0033 AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT
6818-68772-0034 TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT IN JOINT DEBATE THE GIRLS ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AT ONCE WITHIN TWO DAYS EVERY FARMER HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT MISTER FORBES WOULD MEET MISTER HOPKINS
6818-68772-0035 AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
6818-68772-0036 BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
6818-68772-0037 MISTER HOPKINS WAS NOT GREATLY PLEASED THAT HIS CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED HE HAD IMAGINED THAT THE FORBES PARTY WOULD IGNORE IT AND LEAVE HIM THE PRESTIGE OF CROWING OVER HIS OPPONENT'S TIMIDITY
6818-68772-0038 BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW EASILY HE HAD SUBDUED KENNETH AT THE SCHOOL HOUSE MEETING BEFORE THE NOMINATIONS AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO REPEAT THE OPERATION HE WAS MUCH INCENSED AGAINST THE GIRLS WHO WERE WORKING FOR KENNETH FORBES
6818-68772-0039 FOR HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PROVING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CAMPAIGN HE EVEN ATTRIBUTED TO THEM MORE THAN THEY DESERVED FOR UNCLE JOHN'S TELLING ACTIVITIES WERE SO QUIETLY CONDUCTED
6818-68772-0040 THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MISTER HOPKINS MISTER HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS
6818-68772-0041 THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MISTER HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS
6818-68772-0042 DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
6818-68772-0043 LOT OF BOARDING SCHOOL GIRLS WITH MORE BOLDNESS THAN MODESTY TO DICTATE THE POLICIES OF THE COMMUNITY THESE FRIZZLE HEADED FEMALES CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOUR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AS REBELLIOUS AND UNREASONABLE AS THEY ARE THEMSELVES
6818-68772-0044 BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
6818-68772-0045 IF I'M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN MISTER HOPKINS HAS THROWN A BOOMERANG EVERY WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE FETE IS NOW LINKED WITH US AS AN ALLY AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL RESENT THIS FOOLISH CIRCULAR
6818-68772-0046 I'M SORRY SAID KENNETH THAT YOU GIRLS SHOULD BE FORCED TO ENDURE THIS I FEARED SOMETHING LIKE IT WHEN YOU INSISTED ON TAKING A HAND IN THE GAME BUT THEY LAUGHED AT HIM
6818-68772-0047 AND AT MISTER HOPKINS AND DECLARED THEY WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED ONE CANNOT TOUCH PITCH WITHOUT BEING DEFILED SAID MISTER WATSON GRAVELY
6818-68772-0048 AS MISTER HOPKINS KNOWS IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN PITCH I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MY GIRLS HAVE DONE TO FORFEIT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ASSERTED UNCLE JOHN STOUTLY TO ACCUSE THEM OF BOLDNESS OR IMMODESTY IS ABSURD
6818-68772-0049 THEY HAVE MERELY GONE TO WORK IN A BUSINESS LIKE MANNER AND USED THEIR WITS AND COMMON SENSE IN EDUCATING THE VOTERS REALLY MY DEARS I'M MORE PROUD OF YOU TODAY THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE HE CONCLUDED
