6818-76332-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MISSUS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP STAIRS
6818-76332-0001 SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
6818-76332-0002 DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO UP ASKED CYNTHIA ANXIOUSLY PERHAPS SHE NEEDS HELP NO I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE BY HERSELF IT WAS FINE OF YOU CYNTHIA TO SEND HER UP ALONE
6818-76332-0003 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
6818-76332-0004 SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
6818-76332-0005 AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME
6818-76332-0006 I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
6818-76332-0007 SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
6818-76332-0008 ONLY SEVENTEEN I WAS A SOUTHERNER BUT MY HUSBAND CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BROUGHT ME UP NORTH HERE TO LIVE I ALWAYS HATED IT THIS NORTHERN LIFE AND THOUGH I
6818-76332-0009 LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
6818-76332-0010 IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
6818-76332-0011 BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF
6818-76332-0012 WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
6818-76332-0013 I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
6818-76332-0014 AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
6818-76332-0015 AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
6818-76332-0016 AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
6818-76332-0017 I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
6818-76332-0018 WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
6818-76332-0019 TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
6818-76332-0020 BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT RIGHT
6818-76332-0021 HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
6818-76332-0022 I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
6818-76332-0023 AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
6818-76332-0024 THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
6818-76332-0025 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
6818-76332-0026 I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0027 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
6818-76332-0028 I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
6818-76332-0029 I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0030 AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0032 OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
6818-76332-0033 AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
6818-76332-0034 THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
6818-76332-0035 JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM OH DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE YES I KNEW THEM QUITE INTIMATELY
6818-76332-0036 MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6818-76332-0038 YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
6818-76332-0039 THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
6818-76332-0040 MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
6818-76332-0041 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
6818-76332-0042 BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
6818-76332-0043 SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
6818-76332-0044 HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE WHY HOW STRANGE HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
6818-76332-0045 THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
6818-76332-0046 YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
6818-76332-0047 THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MISTER FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
6818-76332-0048 BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
6818-76332-0049 BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
6818-76332-0050 IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
6818-76332-0051 THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
6818-76332-0052 HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
6818-76332-0053 WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
6818-76332-0054 ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6818-76332-0056 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
