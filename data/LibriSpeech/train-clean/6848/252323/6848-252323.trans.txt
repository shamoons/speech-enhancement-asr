6848-252323-0019 THE POET WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS SECURING THEIR HEARTIEST APPROVAL NOR WAS BILLY INSENSIBLE TO SUCH FLATTERIES THE IRRITABILE GENUS HAS ITS SOFT SIDE AND CAN ENJOY TO THE UTTERMOST ITS OWN SUCCESSES

6848-252323-0023 CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
6848-252323-0024 LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
6848-252323-0025 RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE AND THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS ALL WOODED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEHIND ALL IN THE DISTANCE WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN WITH CLOUDS ON THE TOP AND IT WAS JUST THE SEASON WHEN THE TREES IS BEGINNIN TO CHANGE THEIR COLORS
6848-252323-0026 AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
6848-252323-0027 YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
6848-252323-0028 AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
6848-252323-0029 FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
6848-252323-0030 SO MUSICAL AND THE WORDS CAME DROPPIN DOWN LIKE THE CLEAR WATER FILTERIN OVER A ROCKY LEDGE AND GLITTERIN LIKE LITTLE SPANGLES OVER MOSS AND WILD FLOWERS IT WASN'T ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT SCOTCH BALLADS TOO AND ONCE OR TWICE IN ITALIAN THAT HE RECITED
6848-252323-0031 TILL AT LAST HE GAVE OUT IN ALL THE FULNESS OF HIS LIQUID VOICE THEM ELEGANT LINES OUT OF POPE'S HOMER AS WHEN THE MOON REFULGENT LAMP OF NIGHT O'ER HEAVEN'S CLEAR AZURE SPREADS HER SACRED LIGHT
6848-252323-0032 WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
6848-252323-0033 AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
6848-252323-0034 EYE THE BLUE VAULT AND BLESS THE USEFUL LIGHT THE LORD FORGIVE ME BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS AND SAID USEFUL LIGHT I COULDN'T RESTRAIN MYSELF BUT BROKE OUT THAT'S MIGHTY LIKE A BULL ANYHOW
6848-252323-0035 IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
6848-252323-0036 THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
6848-252323-0037 WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
6848-252323-0038 HE MADE ME COME ALONG AT HIS SIDE DISCOORSIN ME ABOUT MY THRAVELS AND ALL I SEEN AND ALL I READ TILL WE REACHED AN ELEGANT LITTLE COTTAGE ON A BANK RIGHT OVER THE LAKE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ME IN AND MADE ME TAKE TAY WITH THE FAMILY AND I SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
6848-252323-0039 AND FOR MANY AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN I JUST THINK OVER THEIR KIND WORDS AND PLEASANT FACES MORE THAN ONE OF THE COMPANY HAD DROPPED OFF ASLEEP DURING BILLY'S NARRATIVE AND OF THE OTHERS THEIR COMPLAISANCE AS LISTENERS APPEARED TAXED TO THE UTMOST
6848-252323-0040 WHILE THE CORPORAL SNORED LOUDLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAD A RIGHT TO INDULGE HIMSELF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THERE'S THE BELL AGAIN MUTTERED ONE THAT'S FROM THE LORD'S ROOM AND CRAGGS STARTING UP BY THE INSTINCT OF HIS OFFICE HASTENED OFF
