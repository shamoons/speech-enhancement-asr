6848-76049-0000 TWO GENTLEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS HER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WHOSE MINDS IT CHANCED WERE VERY BUSILY OCCUPIED BY HER AFFAIRS ONE OF THESE WAS HER FATHER WHO WAS LYING IN HIS BRASS BED IN HIS COMMODIOUS CABIN ON THE HOLLANDIA
6848-76049-0001 REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
6848-76049-0002 AND THE OTHER WAS MISTER GUNTER LAKE ON THE MEGANTIC ONE DAY OUT FROM SANDY HOOK WHO FOUND HIMSELF EQUALLY SLEEPLESS AND PREOCCUPIED AND ALTHOUGH MISTER LAKE WAS A MAN OF VAST ACTIVITIES AND COMPLICATED ENGAGEMENTS
6848-76049-0003 HE WAS COMING NOW TO EUROPE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SEEING V V AND HAVING THINGS OUT WITH HER FULLY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE MADE SUCH AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DELAYS IN COMING TO AMERICA
6848-76049-0004 OLD GRAMMONT AS HE APPEARED UPON THE PILLOW OF HIS BED BY THE LIGHT OF A ROSE SHADED BEDSIDE LAMP WAS A SMALL HEADED GREY HAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH A WRINKLED FACE AND SUNKEN BROWN EYES YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
6848-76049-0005 MITIGATED ONLY BY SUCH EXERCISE AS THE GAME OF POKER AFFORDS HAD INTENSIFIED AN INSTINCTIVE INEXPRESSIVENESS UNDER THE MOST SOLITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OLD GRAMMONT WAS STILL INEXPRESSIVE
6848-76049-0006 HE WAS NOT EVEN TRYING TO SLEEP WHY HE MEDITATED HAD V V STAYED ON IN EUROPE SO MUCH LONGER THAN SHE NEED HAVE DONE AND WHY HAD GUNTER LAKE SUDDENLY GOT INTO A STATE OF MIND ABOUT HER
6848-76049-0007 WHY DIDN'T THE GIRL CONFIDE IN HER FATHER AT LEAST ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT WAS AFOOT SHE HAD THROWN OVER LAKE ONCE AND IT SEEMED SHE WAS GOING TO TURN HIM DOWN AGAIN WELL
6848-76049-0008 WHATEVER ELSE YOU CALLED HER AND NO ONE COULD CALL GRAMMONT BLOOD ALL ORDINARY FLUID OLD GRAMMONT HAD NEVER HAD ANY DELUSIONS ABOUT LAKE IF LAKE'S FATHER HADN'T BEEN A BIG MAN
6848-76049-0009 LAKE WOULD NEVER HAVE COUNTED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL SUPPOSE SHE DID TURN HIM DOWN IN ITSELF THAT WASN'T A THING TO BREAK HER FATHER'S HEART WHAT DID MATTER WAS NOT WHETHER SHE THREW LAKE OVER BUT WHAT SHE THREW HIM OVER FOR
6848-76049-0010 IF IT WAS BECAUSE HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH WELL AND GOOD BUT IF IT WAS FOR SOME OTHER LOVER SOME GOOD LOOKING WORTHLESS IMPOSTOR SOME EUROPEAN TITLE OR SUCHLIKE FOLLY
6848-76049-0011 ENTERTAINING A LOVER BEING POSSIBLY MOST SHAMEFUL THOUGHT IN LOVE LIKE SOME ORDINARY SILLY FEMALE SINKING TO KISSES TO THE DEEDS ONE COULD BUY AND PAY FOR HIS V V
6848-76049-0012 WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT AGAINST HER HE HAD ASKED IN A LOW EVEN VOICE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SIR SAID THE AGENT SUDDENLY WHITE TO THE LIPS
6848-76049-0013 OLD GRAMMONT STARED AT HIS MEMORY OF THAT MOMENT FOR A WHILE THAT AFFAIR WAS ALL RIGHT QUITE ALL RIGHT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND ALSO HAPPILY CASTON WAS AMONG THE DEAD
6848-76049-0014 BUT IT WAS WELL HER BROKEN ENGAGEMENT WITH LAKE HAD BEEN RESUMED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN BROKEN OFF IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY TALK THAT FACT ANSWERED IT AND NOW THAT LAKE HAD SERVED HIS PURPOSE
6848-76049-0015 OLD GRAMMONT DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST IF HE WAS SHELVED V V COULD STAND ALONE OLD GRAMMONT HAD GOT A PHRASE IN HIS MIND THAT LOOKED LIKE DOMINATING THE SITUATION HE DREAMT OF SAYING TO V V
6848-76049-0016 AS AN ABLE YOUNG BUSINESS MAN PERHAPS SOME DAY A LONG TIME AHEAD SHE MIGHT MARRY THERE WASN'T MUCH REASON FOR IT BUT IT MIGHT BE SHE WOULD NOT WISH TO BE CALLED A SPINSTER TAKE A HUSBAND
6848-76049-0017 THOUGHT OLD GRAMMONT WHEN I AM GONE AS ONE TAKES A BUTLER TO MAKE THE HOUSEHOLD COMPLETE IN PREVIOUS MEDITATIONS ON HIS DAUGHTER'S OUTLOOK OLD GRAMMONT HAD FOUND MUCH THAT WAS VERY SUGGESTIVE IN THE PRECEDENT OF QUEEN VICTORIA
6848-76049-0018 SHE HAD HAD NO HUSBAND OF THE LORD AND MASTER TYPE SO TO SPEAK BUT ONLY A PRINCE CONSORT WELL IN HAND WHY SHOULDN'T THE GRAMMONT HEIRESS DOMINATE HER MALE BELONGING IF IT CAME TO THAT IN THE SAME FASHION
6848-76049-0019 NEVER FEAR YET IT WAS A CURIOUS ANOMALY THAT WHILE ONE HAD A THOUSAND WAYS OF DEFENDING ONE'S DAUGHTER AND ONE'S PROPERTY AGAINST THAT DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND THERE WAS NO POWER ON EARTH BY WHICH A FATHER
6848-76049-0020 HIS PROTECTIVE DUTY TO THEM THESE COMPANIONS THESE SEYFFERT WOMEN AND SO FORTH WERE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY THERE WASN'T MUCH THEY KEPT FROM YOU IF YOU GOT THEM CORNERED AND ASKED THEM INTENTLY
6848-76049-0021 STRAIGHT AND LOVELY DESIRABLE AND UNAPPROACHABLE ABOVE THAT SORT OF NONSENSE ABOVE ALL OTHER MASCULINE SUBJUGATION V V I'M GOING TO MAKE A MAN OF YOU HIS MIND GREW CALMER
6848-76049-0022 WHATEVER SHE WANTED IN PARIS SHOULD BE HERS HE'D JUST LET HER RIP THEY'D BE LIKE SWEETHEARTS TOGETHER HE AND HIS GIRL OLD GRAMMONT DOZED OFF INTO DREAMLAND SECTION FIVE
6848-76049-0023 DON'T I KNOW MY DEAR GIRL THAT YOU DON'T LOVE ME YET LET THAT BE AS YOU WISH I WANT NOTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE ME NOTHING AT ALL ALL I ASK IS THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING LIFE HAPPY
6848-76049-0024 AND IT SHALL BE HAPPY FOR YOU ALL I ASK ALL I ASK PROTECT GUARD CHERISH FOR TO MISTER GUNTER LAKE IT SEEMED THERE COULD BE NO LOVELIER THING IN LIFE THAN A WIFE
6848-76049-0025 HE IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN ARRANGE THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'LL BE SOMEONE AT FALMOUTH TO LOOK AFTER US AND PUT US ABOARD THE LINER I MUST WIRE THEM WHERE I CAN PICK UP A TELEGRAM TO MORROW WELLS IN SOMERSET
6848-76049-0026 LOOKING OUT DREAMILY OVER BEAUTIFUL VIEWS THEY WOULD LUNCH IN SHAFTESBURY AND WALK ROUND IT THEN THEY WOULD GO IN THE AFTERNOON THROUGH THE PLEASANT WEST COUNTRY WHERE THE CELTS HAD PREVAILED AGAINST THE OLD FOLK OF THE STONEHENGE TEMPLE
