7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0003 BUT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CALIFORNIA ASK ANY TRAVELLER OR STUDY THE BACKGROUND OF ALMOST ANY PHOTOPLAY IF THE PHOTOPLAY IS THE CONSISTENT UTTERANCE OF ITS SCENES IF THE ACTORS ARE INCARNATIONS OF THE LAND THEY WALK UPON
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0006 HAVE OFTEN WISHED THOSE GENTLEMEN HAD MOORED THEIR BARK IN THE REGION OF LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN PLYMOUTH ROCK THAT BOSTON HAD BEEN FOUNDED THERE AT LAST THAT LANDING IS ACHIEVED
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0009 BUT ARE ALSO GROUNDED IN THE HONEST HOPE OF A HEALTHFUL RIVALRY THEY WANT NEW ROMANTICISTS AND ARTISTS AS INDIGENOUS TO THEIR SOIL AS WAS HAWTHORNE TO WITCH HAUNTED SALEM OR LONGFELLOW TO THE CHESTNUTS OF HIS NATIVE HEATH
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0015 HE DECLARES IT IS AS THOUGH IT WERE PAINTED ON A BROBDINGNAGIAN PIECE OF GILT PAPER AND HE WHO DAMPENS HIS FINGER AND THRUSTS IT THROUGH FINDS AN ALKALI VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LONELY PRICKLY PEAR AND A HEAP OF ASHES FROM A DESERTED CAMP FIRE
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0018 PART OF THE THINNESS OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY ITS YOUTH BUT THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL FACT THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THERE SPREAD OVER SO MANY ACRES OF LAND THEY TRY NOT ONLY TO COUNT THEIR MINES AND ENUMERATE THEIR PALM TREES
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0021 THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL ACCIDENT OF SEPARATION BY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HE BECOMES A MERE SHOUTER HURRAHING SO ASSIDUOUSLY THAT ALL VARIETY IN THE VOICE IS LOST
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0024 HE AND THIS INSTRUMENT MAY FIND THEIR IMMORTALITY TOGETHER AS NEW ENGLAND FOUND ITS SOUL IN THE ESSAYS OF EMERSON
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0027 HERE IS WHERE THE PHOTOPLAY CAN BEGIN TO GIVE HIM A MORE DELICATE UTTERANCE AND HE CAN GO ON INTO STRANGER THINGS AND EVOLVE ALL THE SPLENDOR FILMS INTO HIGHER TYPES FOR THE VERY NAME OF CALIFORNIA IS SPLENDOR
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0030 GROW UP MODELS FOR ALL THE WORLD OF PLANT ARRANGEMENT AND TREE LUXURY OUR MECHANICAL EAST IS REPROVED OUR TENSION IS RELAXED OUR UGLINESS IS CHALLENGED EVERY TIME WE LOOK UPON THOSE GARDEN PATHS AND FORESTS
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0033 THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
