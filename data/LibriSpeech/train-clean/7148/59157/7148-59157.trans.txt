7148-59157-0000 AND IN THE RESULT WE CAN ACCOMPANY KEATS THROUGH THE GLAD AND SAD AND MAD AND BAD HOURS OF HIS SHORT AND MARVELLOUS LIFE
7148-59157-0001 WE ARE STILL LEFT IN THE DARK IT IS TRUE AS TO KEATS'S RACE AND DESCENT WHETHER KEATS'S FATHER CAME TO LONDON FROM CORNWALL OR NOT SIR SIDNEY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE ON
7148-59157-0002 THE RATHER SHAKY EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD IF IT SHOULD HEREAFTER TURN OUT THAT KEATS WAS A CORNISHMAN AT ONE REMOVE MATTHEW ARNOLD'S CONJECTURE AS TO THE CELTIC ELEMENT IN HIM
7148-59157-0003 AT THE SIGN OF THE SWAN AND HOOP FINSBURY PAVEMENT AND MARRIED HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER IT WAS AT THE STABLE AT THE SWAN AND HOOP NOT A PUBLIC HOUSE BY THE WAY BUT A LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0004 THAT KEATS WAS PREMATURELY BORN AT THE END OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
7148-59157-0005 HE WAS SCARCELY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE HE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN WHEN HIS MOTHER WHO HAD RE MARRIED UNHAPPILY AND THEN BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND DIED A VICTIM OF CHRONIC RHEUMATISM AND CONSUMPTION
7148-59157-0006 IT IS FROM HIS MOTHER THAT KEATS SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED HIS IMPETUOUS AND PASSIONATE NATURE THERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF A CERTAIN WHOLESALE TEA DEALER THE RESPECTABILITY OF WHOSE TRADE MAY HAVE INCLINED HIM TO CENSORIOUSNESS
7148-59157-0007 SHE WAS A PERSON OF UNBRIDLED TEMPERAMENT AND THAT IN HER LATER YEARS SHE FELL INTO LOOSE WAYS AND WAS NO CREDIT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE HAD OTHER QUALITIES BESIDES THOSE MENTIONED BY THE TEA DEALER IS SHOWN BY THE PASSIONATE AFFECTION
7148-59157-0008 THAT EXISTED BETWEEN HER AND HER SON JOHN ONCE AS A YOUNG CHILD WHEN SHE WAS ORDERED TO BE KEPT QUIET DURING AN ILLNESS HE IS SAID TO HAVE INSISTED ON KEEPING WATCH AT HER DOOR WITH AN OLD SWORD AND ALLOWING NO ONE TO GO IN
7148-59157-0009 AS SHE LAY DYING HE SAT UP WHOLE NIGHTS WITH HER IN A GREAT CHAIR WOULD SUFFER NOBODY TO GIVE HER MEDICINE OR EVEN COOK HER FOOD BUT HIMSELF AND READ NOVELS TO HER IN HER INTERVALS OF EASE
7148-59157-0010 THEIR GRANDFATHER THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0011 TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0012 AT WRITING POETRY HE DID NOT BEGIN TO WRITE SAYS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN TILL HE WAS NEAR EIGHTEEN
7148-59157-0013 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON INDEED IN ALL THE KEATS CIRCLE TO WHOM ONE IS MORE PASSIONATELY GRATEFUL THAN TO COWDEN CLARKE THAT IS FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0014 WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
7148-59157-0015 SHE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY HIS GOOD FAIRY AS A POET THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER UPON WHICH ONE IS SERIOUSLY DISPOSED TO QUARREL WITH SIR SIDNEY COLVIN AS A BIOGRAPHER HE DOES NOT EMPHASIZE AS HE OUGHT THE DEBT WE ARE UNDER TO FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0016 AS THE INTENSIFIER OF KEATS'S GENIUS THE MINX AS KEATS IRRITABLY CALLED HER WHO TRANSFORMED HIM IN A FEW MONTHS FROM A POET OF STILL DOUBTFUL FAME INTO A MASTER AND AN IMMORTAL THE ATTACHMENT
7148-59157-0017 SIR SIDNEY THINKS WAS A MISFORTUNE FOR HIM THOUGH HE QUALIFIES THIS BY ADDING THAT SO PROBABLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST ANY PASSION FOR A WOMAN HAVE BEEN WELL LET US TEST THIS MISFORTUNE BY ITS CONSEQUENCES
7148-59157-0018 IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HE WROTE THE EVE OF SAINT AGNES DURING THE SPRING OF THAT YEAR HE WROTE THE ODE TO PSYCHE THE ODE ON A GRECIAN URN THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE
7148-59157-0019 AND WROTE THE ODE TO AUTUMN
7148-59157-0020 IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0021 WHICH RESULTED FROM HIS TRANSLATION INTO A LOVER IT SEEMS TO ME A TREACHERY TO KEATS'S MEMORY TO BELITTLE A WOMAN WHO WAS AT LEAST THE OCCASION OF SUCH A PASSIONATE EXPENDITURE OF GENIUS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN
7148-59157-0022 DOES HIS BEST TO BE FAIR TO FANNY
7148-59157-0023 AS WELL AS ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO TRANSMUTE IT INTO PERFECT LITERATURE HE SEEMS TO HAVE ADMIRED WOMEN VULGARLY AS CREATURES WHOSE HANDS WERE WAITING TO BE SQUEEZED RATHER THAN AS EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS
7148-59157-0024 WAS ESSENTIALLY A CYNICISM IN THE EXHAUSTED DON JUAN MOOD HENCE KEATS WAS ALMOST DOOMED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH PROVOCATION RATHER THAN WITH WHAT THE VICTORIANS CALLED SOUL HIS DESTINY
7148-59157-0025 WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0026 SIR SIDNEY COLVIN REGRETS THAT THE LOVE LETTERS OF KEATS TO FANNY WERE EVER PUBLISHED IT WOULD BE AS REASONABLE IN MY OPINION
7148-59157-0027 HAS ALMOST NO COUNTERPART IN BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING MISS BRAWNE HE WRITES TO BROWN FROM YARMOUTH IS BEYOND EVERYTHING HORRIBLE THE SENSE OF DARKNESS COMING OVER ME
7148-59157-0028 I ETERNALLY SEE HER FIGURE ETERNALLY VANISHING AND WHEN HE REACHES NAPLES HE WRITES TO THE SAME FRIEND I CAN BEAR TO DIE I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HER O GOD
7148-59157-0029 MY IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLY VIVID ABOUT HER I SEE HER I HEAR HER O THAT I COULD BE BURIED NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES I AM AFRAID TO WRITE TO HER
7148-59157-0030 TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM HER TO SEE HER HANDWRITING WOULD BREAK MY HEART EVEN TO HEAR OF HER ANYHOW TO SEE HER NAME WRITTEN WOULD BE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
7148-59157-0031 SANS MERCI SIR SIDNEY IS ALL IN FAVOUR AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR HIS PREFERENCE OF THE EARLIER VERSION WHICH BEGINS O WHAT CAN AIL THEE KNIGHT AT ARMS ALONE AND PALELY LOITERING
7148-59157-0032 BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
7148-59157-0033 TO ACCUSE HUNT OF WISHING TO ALTER KNIGHT AT ARMS TO WRETCHED WIGHT SEEMS TO ME UNWARRANTABLE GUESSING SURELY A MUCH MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT KEATS
7148-59157-0034 EVERY EDITION OF KEATS OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS JUST AS IT OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS OF HYPERION NOTHING THAT I HAVE WRITTEN WILL BE REGARDED I TRUST AS
7148-59157-0035 DEPRECIATING THE ESSENTIAL EXCELLENCE POWER AND IN ITS SCHOLARLY WAY EVEN THE GREATNESS OF SIR SIDNEY COLVIN'S BOOK BUT A CERTAIN FALSE EMPHASIS HERE AND THERE
7148-59157-0036 AND HIS LUXURIOUS LOVE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0037 HIS MORBIDNESS HIS MAWKISHNESS HIS FASCINATION AS BY SERPENTS ON THE OTHER BUT IN THE RESULTANT PORTRAIT IT IS A TOO RESPECTABLE AND VIRILE KEATS THAT EMERGES KEATS WAS MORE VIRILE AS A MAN
7148-59157-0038 THAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD HE DOES NOT OWE HIS IMMORTALITY TO HIS VIRILITY HOWEVER HE OWES IT TO HIS SERVITUDE TO GOLDEN IMAGES TO HIS CITIZENSHIP OF THE WORLD OF THE SENSES TO HIS BONDAGE TO PHYSICAL LOVE
7148-59157-0039 HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
7148-59157-0040 WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SURPASSED IN LITERATURE THAT HIS OWN ACHIEVEMENT LIES HE IS GREAT AMONG THE PAGANS NOT AMONG THE PROPHETS UNLESS WE KEEP THIS CLEARLY IN MIND OUR PRAISE OF HIM WILL NOT BE APPRECIATION
7148-59157-0041 IT WILL BE BUT A SOUNDING FUNERAL SPEECH INSTEAD OF COMMUNION WITH A LOVELY AND BROKEN SPIRIT
