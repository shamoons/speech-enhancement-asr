7148-7763-0000 CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
7148-7763-0001 IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0002 MIGHT TRULY BE CALLED AN OBJECT IN LIFE TO BE A REFORMER OF THE WORLD MY CONCEPTION OF MY OWN HAPPINESS WAS ENTIRELY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS OBJECT THE PERSONAL SYMPATHIES I WISHED FOR WERE THOSE OF FELLOW LABOURERS
7148-7763-0003 IN THIS ENTERPRISE I ENDEAVOURED TO PICK UP AS MANY FLOWERS AS I COULD BY THE WAY
7148-7763-0004 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0006 AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX I WAS IN A DULL STATE OF NERVES SUCH AS EVERYBODY IS OCCASIONALLY LIABLE TO UNSUSCEPTIBLE TO ENJOYMENT OR PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ONE OF THOSE MOODS
7148-7763-0007 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT THE QUESTION DIRECTLY TO MYSELF SUPPOSE THAT ALL YOUR OBJECTS IN LIFE WERE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONS AND OPINIONS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
7148-7763-0008 THE WHOLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH MY LIFE WAS CONSTRUCTED FELL DOWN ALL MY HAPPINESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CONTINUAL PURSUIT OF THIS END THE END HAD CEASED TO CHARM AND HOW COULD THERE EVER AGAIN BE ANY INTEREST IN THE MEANS
7148-7763-0009 I AWOKE TO A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WOFUL FACT I CARRIED IT WITH ME INTO ALL COMPANIES INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS HARDLY ANYTHING HAD POWER TO CAUSE ME EVEN A FEW MINUTES OBLIVION OF IT
7148-7763-0010 FOR SOME MONTHS THE CLOUD SEEMED TO GROW THICKER AND THICKER THE LINES IN COLERIDGE'S DEJECTION I WAS NOT THEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM EXACTLY DESCRIBE MY CASE A GRIEF WITHOUT A PANG VOID
7148-7763-0011 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0012 OR WITH THE ACCUSTOMED FEELING MINUS ALL ITS CHARM AND I BECAME PERSUADED THAT MY LOVE OF MANKIND AND OF EXCELLENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAD WORN ITSELF OUT
7148-7763-0013 I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
7148-7763-0014 I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0015 AND I SAW NO USE IN GIVING HIM THE PAIN OF THINKING THAT HIS PLANS HAD FAILED WHEN THE FAILURE WAS PROBABLY IRREMEDIABLE AND AT ALL EVENTS BEYOND THE POWER OF
7148-7763-0016 HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0017 AND THE MORE I DWELT UPON IT THE MORE HOPELESS IT APPEARED MY COURSE OF STUDY
7148-7763-0018 WHETHER OF A GOOD OR OF A BAD KIND WERE THE RESULTS OF ASSOCIATION THAT WE LOVE ONE THING AND HATE ANOTHER TAKE PLEASURE IN ONE SORT OF ACTION OR CONTEMPLATION
7148-7763-0019 WITH ALL THINGS BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT WHOLE
7148-7763-0020 ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
7148-7763-0021 SALUTARY ASSOCIATIONS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE TRUSTED ALTOGETHER TO THE OLD FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS PRAISE AND BLAME REWARD AND PUNISHMENT NOW
7148-7763-0022 I DID NOT DOUBT THAT BY THESE MEANS BEGUN EARLY AND APPLIED UNREMITTINGLY INTENSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ESPECIALLY OF PAIN MIGHT BE CREATED
7148-7763-0023 AND MIGHT PRODUCE DESIRES AND AVERSIONS CAPABLE OF LASTING UNDIMINISHED TO THE END OF LIFE BUT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL AND CASUAL IN ASSOCIATIONS THUS PRODUCED
7148-7763-0024 WHAT I HAD ALWAYS BEFORE RECEIVED WITH INCREDULITY THAT THE HABIT OF ANALYSIS HAS A TENDENCY TO WEAR AWAY THE FEELINGS AS INDEED IT HAS WHEN NO OTHER MENTAL HABIT IS CULTIVATED
7148-7763-0025 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026 THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
7148-7763-0028 ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029 TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0030 TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
7148-7763-0031 OF THE ENTIRE INSUFFICIENCY OF WHICH TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE NO ONE HAD A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN I HAD THESE WERE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE BY WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO ME
7148-7763-0032 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-7763-0033 AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
7148-7763-0034 THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
7148-7763-0035 AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
