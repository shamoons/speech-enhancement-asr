7178-34644-0000 THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
7178-34644-0001 GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
7178-34644-0002 AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
7178-34644-0003 HE FELT HIMSELF PLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH THE SHERIFF HAD JUST VACATED HE LET IT BE DONE WITHOUT SEEKING AN EXPLANATION WHEN GWYNPLAINE WAS SEATED THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM AND THE WAPENTAKE RETIRED A FEW STEPS
7178-34644-0004 AND STOOD UPRIGHT AND MOTIONLESS BEHIND THE SEAT THEN THE SHERIFF PLACED HIS BUNCH OF ROSES ON THE STONE TABLE PUT ON SPECTACLES WHICH THE SECRETARY GAVE HIM DREW FROM THE BUNDLES OF PAPERS WHICH COVERED THE TABLE A SHEET OF PARCHMENT
7178-34644-0005 YELLOW GREEN TORN AND JAGGED IN PLACES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FOLDED IN VERY SMALL FOLDS AND OF WHICH ONE SIDE WAS COVERED WITH WRITING STANDING UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP HE HELD THE SHEET CLOSE TO HIS EYES
7178-34644-0006 AND IN HIS MOST SOLEMN TONE READ AS FOLLOWS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST THIS PRESENT DAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETIETH YEAR OF OUR LORD
7178-34644-0007 HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
7178-34644-0008 THAT CHILD WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS BY ORDER OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE SECOND THAT CHILD IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34644-0009 THE ONLY LEGITIMATE SON OF LORD LINNAEUS CLANCHARLIE BARON CLANCHARLIE AND HUNKERVILLE MARQUIS OF CORLEONE IN SICILY A PEER OF ENGLAND AND OF ANN BRADSHAW HIS WIFE BOTH DECEASED
7178-34644-0010 THAT CHILD IS THE INHERITOR OF THE ESTATES AND TITLES OF HIS FATHER FOR THIS REASON HE WAS SOLD MUTILATED DISFIGURED AND PUT OUT OF THE WAY BY DESIRE OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY
7178-34644-0011 THAT CHILD WAS BROUGHT UP AND TRAINED TO BE A MOUNTEBANK AT MARKETS AND FAIRS HE WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PEER HIS FATHER AND TEN POUNDS STERLING WERE GIVEN TO THE KING AS HIS PURCHASE MONEY

7178-34644-0013 AND DISFIGURED BY A FLEMING OF FLANDERS CALLED HARDQUANONNE WHO ALONE IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE SECRETS AND MODES OF TREATMENT OF DOCTOR CONQUEST THE CHILD WAS DESTINED BY US TO BE A LAUGHING MASK
7178-34644-0014 WHICH STAMPS AN EVERLASTING LAUGH UPON THE FACE THE CHILD BY MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO HARDQUANONNE WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND MADE INSENSIBLE DURING ITS PERFORMANCE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OPERATION WHICH HE UNDERWENT
7178-34644-0015 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LORD CLANCHARLIE HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF GWYNPLAINE THIS FACT IS THE RESULT OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SLIGHT POWERS OF MEMORY HE COULD HAVE HAD WHEN HE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED
7178-34644-0017 THE OPERATION IS SO UNIQUE AND SINGULAR THAT THOUGH AFTER LONG YEARS THIS CHILD SHOULD HAVE COME TO BE AN OLD MAN INSTEAD OF A CHILD AND HIS BLACK LOCKS SHOULD HAVE TURNED WHITE
7178-34644-0018 AT THE TIME THAT I AM WRITING THIS HARDQUANONNE WHO HAS PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE FACTS AND PARTICIPATED AS PRINCIPAL THEREIN IS DETAINED IN THE PRISONS OF HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF ORANGE

7178-34644-0021 THE UNDERSIGNED BROUGHT UP AND KEPT FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES THE LITTLE LORD BOUGHT BY US OF THE KING TO DAY FLYING FROM ENGLAND TO AVOID HARDQUANONNE'S ILL FORTUNE
7178-34644-0022 OUR FEAR OF THE PENAL INDICTMENTS PROHIBITIONS AND FULMINATIONS OF PARLIAMENT HAS INDUCED US TO DESERT AT NIGHT FALL ON THE COAST OF PORTLAND THE SAID CHILD GWYNPLAINE WHO IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
