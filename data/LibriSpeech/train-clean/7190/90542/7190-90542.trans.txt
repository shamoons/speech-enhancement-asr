7190-90542-0000 THE IDENTITY OF THE FINAL VICTIM
7190-90542-0001 AS AN EXCUSE I TALKED OVER CASES WITH HIM BUT HE SELDOM VOLUNTEERED AN OPINION OFTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY UNINTERESTED TRUTH TO TELL I WAS NOT THERE FOR HIS OPINION BUT TO SEE HIS GRANDDAUGHTER A DETECTIVE IN LOVE SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE AN ABSURDITY
7190-90542-0002 BUT SUCH WAS MY CASE AND SINCE ZENA'S MANNER DID NOT SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ME MY LOVE AFFAIR SEEMED RATHER A HOPELESS ONE MY ASSOCIATION WITH CHRISTOPHER QUARLES HAS HOWEVER
7190-90542-0003 LED TO THE SOLUTION OF SOME STRANGE MYSTERIES AND SINCE MY OWN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN I MAY CONFINE MYSELF TO THOSE CASES WHICH SINGLE HANDED I SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO SOLVE I KNOW THAT IN MANY OF THEM I WAS CREDITED WITH HAVING UNRAVELED THE MYSTERY
7190-90542-0004 BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE PROFESSOR QUARLES PERSISTED IN REMAINING IN THE BACKGROUND IF I DID THE SPADE WORK THE DEDUCTIONS WERE HIS THEY WERE ALL CASES WITH PECULIAR FEATURES IN THEM
7190-90542-0005 HE WAS OFTEN AS ASTONISHED AT MY ACUMEN IN FOLLOWING A CLEW AS I WAS AT HIS MARVELOUS THEORIES
7190-90542-0006 PERHAPS HIS CURIOUS POWER WAS NEVER MORE NOTICEABLE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE WITHAN MURDER A FARMER RETURNING FROM MEDWORTH THE NEIGHBORING MARKET TOWN ONE NIGHT IN JANUARY
7190-90542-0007 BY EVENING THE CLOUDS HAD GONE THE MOON SAILED IN A CLEAR SKY AND LOOKING ROUND TO FIND THE CAUSE OF HIS HORSE'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE FARMER SAW A MAN LYING ON A HEAP OF SNOW UNDER THE OPPOSITE HEDGE HE WAS DEAD MORE HE WAS HEADLESS
7190-90542-0008 IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME DAYS LATER THAT THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND IN THE INTERVAL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN IDLE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE MAN WAS POORLY DRESSED THAT HIS HANDS PROVED HE WAS USED TO MANUAL LABOR BUT THERE WAS NO MARK EITHER ON HIS BODY OR ON HIS CLOTHING
7190-90542-0009 NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
7190-90542-0010 AND APPARENTLY NO STRUGGLE HAD TAKEN PLACE FOOTPRINTS NEARLY OBLITERATED
7190-90542-0011 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0012 AND WOULD BE FOUND BURIED IN THE WOOD IT WAS NOT FOUND HOWEVER AND THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON PANIC FOR A FEW DAYS THE WITHAN MURDER SEEMED UNIQUE IN ATROCITIES AND THEN CAME A COMMUNICATION FROM THE FRENCH POLICE
7190-90542-0013 SOME TWO YEARS AGO AN ALMOST IDENTICAL MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED OUTSIDE A VILLAGE IN NORMANDY IN THIS CASE ALSO THE HEAD WAS MISSING AND NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND UPON THE BODY TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM HE WAS WELL DRESSED AND A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO CARRY PAPERS WITH HIM BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0014 AND THE MURDER HAD REMAINED A MYSTERY THESE WERE THE POINTS KNOWN AND CONJECTURED WHEN THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND MY INVESTIGATIONS ADDED LITTLE TO THEM ONE POINT HOWEVER IMPRESSED ME I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE SHOWN TO ME HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN ENGLAND
7190-90542-0015 THEY WERE POOR WORN ALMOST THREADBARE BUT THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AND THE CUT WAS NOT ENGLISH THAT IT WAS FRENCH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFIRM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND SO I FASHIONED A FRAGILE LINK WITH THE NORMANDY CRIME
7190-90542-0016 ON THIS OCCASION I WENT TO QUARLES WITH THE OBJECT OF INTERESTING HIM IN THE WITHAN CASE AND HE FORESTALLED ME BY BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE ROOM HERE I MAY MENTION A FACT WHICH I HAD NOT DISCOVERED AT FIRST
7190-90542-0017 WHENEVER HE WAS INTERESTED IN A CASE I WAS ALWAYS TAKEN INTO HIS EMPTY ROOM AT OTHER TIMES WE WERE IN THE DINING ROOM OR THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS THE EMPTY ROOM ON THIS OCCASION AND ZENA REMAINED WITH US
7190-90542-0018 THE FOREIGN CUT OF THE CLOTHES MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE HE SAID I AM NOT SURE IS THIS WOOD YOU MENTION OF ANY GREAT EXTENT NO IT RUNS BESIDE THE ROAD FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD WITHAN NO IT WAS NEAR THE WITHAN END OF IT THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0019 ANY TRACES THAT THE HEAD WAS CARRIED TO THE WOOD THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY YES AND NOT A TRACE AFTERWARD THE GROUND IN THE WOOD WAS SEARCHED AT THE TIME AND I HAVE BEEN OVER IT CAREFULLY SINCE THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD THERE RUNS A DITCH
7190-90542-0020 WHICH IS CONTINUED AS A DIVISION BETWEEN TWO FIELDS WHICH FORM PART OF THE FARM LAND BEHIND THE WOOD BY WALKING ALONG THIS THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE WOOD WITHOUT LEAVING TRACKS BEHIND HIM A GOOD POINT WIGAN AND WHERE WOULD THAT DITCH LEAD HIM EVENTUALLY TO THE HIGH ROAD
7190-90542-0021 WHICH RUNS ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WITHAN ROAD MUCH WATER IN THE DITCH ASKED QUARLES HALF A FOOT WHEN I WENT THERE
7190-90542-0022 THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT WASN'T THERE FULL OR NEAR IT I RETURNED AND HOW SOON WAS THE ALARM RAISED ALONG THE COUNTRYSIDE
7190-90542-0023 AND AFTER GOING TO THE VILLAGE THE FARMER RETURNED TO MEDWORTH FOR THE POLICE
7190-90542-0024 SAID ZENA AND IF HE WERE MET ON THE ROAD CARRYING A BAG HE WOULD ARREST ATTENTION WHY CARRYING A BAG ASKED QUARLES WITH THE HEAD IN IT SHE ANSWERED THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT WIGAN CHUCKLED QUARLES OF COURSE
7190-90542-0025 THE HEAD MAY BE BURIED IN THE WOOD SAID ZENA QUARLES LOOKED AT ME INQUIRINGLY
7190-90542-0026 ONE OR TWO DOUBTFUL PLACES I HAD DUG UP I THINK THE MURDERER MUST HAVE TAKEN THE HEAD WITH HIM TO BURY SOMEWHERE ELSE ASKED QUARLES
7190-90542-0027 A MAD DOCTOR BENT ON BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IS THAT YOUR THEORY WIGAN
7190-90542-0028 JANUARY THE SEVENTEENTH NEARLY THE SAME DATE AS THE ENGLISH ONE SAID ZENA TWO YEARS INTERVENING I RETURNED
7190-90542-0029 AT THAT DATE SAID QUARLES YOU HAVE A THEORY PROFESSOR AN OUTLANDISH ONE WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO NO I DO NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT I NEVER MENTION MY THEORIES UNTIL I HAVE SOME FACTS TO SUPPORT THEM
7190-90542-0030 I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO MAKE INQUIRY WHETHER ANY SIMILAR CRIME HAD HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE JANUARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AND HAD THE SAME INQUIRY MADE IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY MURDER BEARING THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE WITHAN TRAGEDY
7190-90542-0031 A FEW DAYS LATER QUARLES TELEGRAPHED ME TO MEET HIM AT KINGS CROSS AND WE TRAVELED NORTH TOGETHER WAIT HE SAID WHEN I BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM I AM NOT SURE YET MY THEORY SEEMS ABSURD WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IF IT IS
7190-90542-0032 WE TOOK ROOMS AT A HOTEL IN MEDWORTH QUARLES EXPLAINING THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE SOME DAYS NEXT MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING TO WITHAN AS I HAD EXPECTED HE TOOK ME TO THE POLICE COURT
7190-90542-0033 THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
7190-90542-0034 FIVE OR SIX MILES THE ROAD WINDS A LOT IT'S A DEAL NEARER AS THE CROW FLIES YOU NEED NOT WAIT FOR US DRIVER MY FRIEND AND I ARE GOING TO WALK BACK THE COACHMAN POCKETED HIS MONEY AND DROVE AWAY COULDN'T KEEP HIM WAITING ALL NIGHT AS WE MAY HAVE TO DO
7190-90542-0035 SAID QUARLES MIND YOU WIGAN I'M VERY DOUBTFUL ABOUT MY THEORY AT LEAST I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT I SHALL FIND THE FACTS I WANT A FEW HOURS WILL SETTLE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AFTER WALKING ALONG THE ROAD FOR ABOUT A MILE
7190-90542-0036 QUARLES SCRAMBLED THROUGH A HEDGE INTO A WOOD BY THE ROADSIDE
7190-90542-0037 SHOULD WE MEET ANYONE BLAME ME SAY I AM A DODDERING OLD FOOL WHO WOULD WALK UNDER THE TREES
7190-90542-0038 DO YOU GO ARMED ALWAYS I ANSWERED I DO SOMETIMES HE SAID TAPPING HIS POCKET WE MIGHT COME UP AGAINST DANGER IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT IF I TELL YOU TO SHOOT SHOOT AND QUICKLY
7190-90542-0039 YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
7190-90542-0040 WHETHER HE HAD STUDIED THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD I CANNOT SAY BUT HE DID NOT HESITATE IN HIS DIRECTION UNTIL HE REACHED A HIGH KNOLL WHICH WAS CLEAR OF THE WOOD AND COMMANDED A CONSIDERABLE VIEW WE WERE TRESPASSERS IN A PRIVATE PARK
7190-90542-0041 TO OUR RIGHT WAS A LARGE HOUSE ONLY PARTIALLY SEEN THROUGH ITS SCREEN OF TREES BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY MELLOW WITH AGE TO OUR LEFT TOWARD WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXTREMITY OF THE PARK WAS HILLY GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN WILD
7190-90542-0042 TO THIS QUARLES POINTED THAT IS OUR WAY HE SAID WE'LL USE WHAT COVER WE CAN WE PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD AGAIN AND WERE SOON IN THE WILDERNESS FORCING OUR WAY SOMETIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH
7190-90542-0043 ONCE OR TWICE THE PROFESSOR GAVE ME A WARNING GESTURE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DEFINITE GOAL AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF EXCITEMENT AS I FOLLOWED HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT EXPLORING EVERY LITTLE RAVINE HE COULD DISCOVER
7190-90542-0044 GRUNTING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT EACH TIME HE FAILED TO FIND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR I SAID I WASN'T CERTAIN HE WHISPERED WHEN OUR PATH HAD LED US INTO A DAMP HOLLOW WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY MAN FOR CENTURIES MY THEORY SEEMS
7190-90542-0045 AND YET THIS IS SUCH A LIKELY PLACE THERE MUST BE A WAY HE WAS GOING FORWARD AGAIN THE HOLLOW WAS SURROUNDED BY PERPENDICULAR WALLS OF SAND AND CHALK IT WAS A PIT IN FACT WHICH NATURE HAD FILLED WITH VEGETATION THE WAY WE HAD COME SEEMED THE ONLY WAY INTO IT
7190-90542-0046 AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
7190-90542-0047 SAID QUARLES LET'S GET ON THE ROOF I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS SO HELP ME UP IT WAS NOT MUCH HELP HE WANTED IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE ON THE ROOF AS I THOUGHT HE SAID
7190-90542-0048 WE'LL GO CAREFULLY SAID QUARLES THERE MAY BE WORSE THAN POACHERS TRAPS HERE WITHOUT HELP FROM ME HE DROPPED FROM THE ROOF AND I FOLLOWED HIM THE NATURAL PASSAGE WAS WINDING AND ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG AND OPENED INTO ANOTHER PIT OF SOME SIZE
7190-90542-0049 A PIT I CALL IT BUT IT WAS AS MUCH A CAVE AS A PIT PART OF IT RUNNING DEEPLY INTO THE EARTH AND ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF IT BEING OPEN TO THE SKY THE CAVE PART HAD A ROUGH SANDY FLOOR AND HERE WAS A LONG SHED OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
7190-90542-0050 THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
7190-90542-0051 I THINK WE ARE ALONE HERE BUT KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN THE SHED WAS EVIDENTLY USED SOMETIMES THERE WAS A STONE SLAB WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FIREPLACE AND FROM A BEAM ABOVE HUNG A SHORT CHAIN ON WHICH A POT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WE'LL GET AWAY QUICKLY SAID QUARLES
7190-90542-0052 WHEN IN ABOUT THIRTY HOURS TIME THE PROFESSOR'S SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS MARVELOUS
7190-90542-0053 I DARESAY ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE OVER THE HOUSE
7190-90542-0054 HE WAS ALWAYS AS SECRET AS THE GRAVE UNTIL HE HAD PROVED HIS THEORY AND THEN HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO FORGET THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND SHRANK FROM PUBLICITY
7190-90542-0055 WE GO THERE AGAIN THIS EVENING HE SAID AFTER LUNCH NEXT DAY SO A RESTFUL AFTERNOON WILL SUIT US IT WAS GETTING DARK WHEN WE SET OUT AND AGAIN QUARLES'S UNERRING SENSE OF LOCALITY ASTONISHED ME HE LED THE WAY WITHOUT HESITATION
7190-90542-0056 I THINK WE ARE FIRST BUT GREAT CARE IS NECESSARY HE WHISPERED WE CREPT FORWARD AND CONCEALED OURSELVES AMONG THE SCRUB VEGETATION WHICH GREW IN THAT PART OF THE PIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE SKY IT WAS DARK THE LONG SHED BARELY DISCERNIBLE
7190-90542-0057 BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS PARTICULAR ABOUT OUR POSITION WE MAY HAVE TO CREEP A LITTLE NEARER PRESENTLY HE WHISPERED FROM HERE WE CAN DO SO SILENCE WIGAN AND DON'T BE ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING THE WAITING SEEMED LONG MOONLIGHT WAS PRESENTLY ABOVE US
7190-90542-0058 THROWING THE CAVE PART OF THE PIT INTO GREATER SHADOW THAN EVER I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HOW LONG WE HAD WAITED IN UTTER SILENCE WHEN QUARLES TOUCHED MY ARM SOMEONE WAS COMING AND WITH NO PARTICULAR STEALTH
7190-90542-0059 I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE RAISED FLOOR OF THE SHED A MAN'S STEP AND ONLY ONE MAN'S I HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME I THINK HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER ONCE AND WENT UP AGAIN
7190-90542-0060 THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
7190-90542-0061 HE WAS SHORT THICK SET AND QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS
7190-90542-0062 WHEN HE GOT DOWN AGAIN I SAW THAT A BUNDLE WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE FIRE
7190-90542-0063 ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
7190-90542-0064 FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
7190-90542-0065 WERE FIVE OR SIX HUMAN HEADS BLACKENED SHRIVELED FACES WHICH SEEMED TO GRIN HORRIBLY AS THEY SWUNG DEEPLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIT UP BY THE FLICKER OF THE FLAMES DO YOU SEE WIGAN QUARLES ASKED AGAIN YES
7190-90542-0066 AND THE MAN WHO IS HE ON THE BENCH YESTERDAY SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM
7190-90542-0067 FOR AN HOUR TWO THREE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT HORRIBLE BUNDLE SWUNG OVER THE FIRE AND THE MAN SAT ON HIS BLOCK OF WOOD STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7190-90542-0068 AND I WAITED EXPECTING SOME FURTHER REVELATION LISTENING FOR OTHER FOOTSTEPS NONE CAME THE FIRE FLICKERED LOWER AND WENT OUT THE MOON HAD SET AND THE COLD OF THE EARLY MORNING GOT INTO MY BONES
7190-90542-0069 IN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THE MAN MOVED ABOUT THE SHED AGAIN AND PRESENTLY I HEARD HIM GO PATIENCE WHISPERED QUARLES AS I STARTED UP TO GO AFTER HIM HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY
7190-90542-0070 MY DEAR WIGAN HE SAID WHEN AT LAST HE CONDESCENDED TO TALK IT WAS ZENA WHO FIRST SET ME ON THE RIGHT ROAD WHEN SHE REMARKED THAT A MAN WHO HAD WALKED IN A DITCH CARRYING A BAG WOULD ARREST ATTENTION TWO POINTS WERE SUGGESTED FIRST
7190-90542-0071 THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
7190-90542-0072 WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
7190-90542-0073 I SOUGHT FOR SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS MANNER AND FOUND NONE YET HIS HISTORY COINCIDED WITH MY THEORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE NOTHING RATHER AN INTERESTING CAREER BUT WITH AN HEREDITARY TAINT IN IT QUARLES WENT ON
7190-90542-0074 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90542-0075 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
7190-90542-0076 I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT FOR THE LAST HALF DOZEN YEARS SIR HENRY HAS NOT BEEN IN ENGLAND IN JANUARY YOU THINK I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER HEADS MISSING IF HE HAD BEEN QUARLES ANSWERED
7190-90542-0077 HE WAS SANE ENOUGH TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HE WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THIS TIME OF THE YEAR CAME ROUND AT THE FULL MOON HE IS ALWAYS QUEER WITNESS LAST NIGHT BUT HE IS ONLY DANGEROUS IN JANUARY DANGEROUS I MEAN WITHOUT PROVOCATION
7190-90542-0078 TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
7190-90542-0079 AND THE INSANE DESIRE PROVED IRRESISTIBLE HE WAS CUNNING TOO HE MUST KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YET THE MAN HE KILLED WAS UNKNOWN WE SHALL FIND PRESENTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE VICTIM WAS SOME WANDERER RETURNING UNEXPECTEDLY TO FRIENDS IN WITHAN
7190-90542-0080 SIR HENRY WAITING IN THE WOOD PERHAPS FOR HOURS MAY HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS TO PASS BEFORE THIS MAN CAME HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND ATTACKED HIM BUT THE HEAD
7190-90542-0081 WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
7190-90542-0082 THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS DISEASED BRAIN AND FASCINATED HIM YOU SEE HOW MY THEORY GREW THEN I LOOKED FOR THE ACTUAL PROOF WHICH WE FOUND LAST NIGHT
7190-90542-0083 THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
