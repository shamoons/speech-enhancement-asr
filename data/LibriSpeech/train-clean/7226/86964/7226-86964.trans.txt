7226-86964-0000 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
7226-86964-0001 IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
7226-86964-0002 AT THE FOOT OF OUR HOST'S ORCHARD WHICH HE HAD DESCRIBED AS A CATCH BASIN FOR HUMAN FLOATERS OUR COURSE STILL LAY AMONG LARGE DENSELY WOODED ISLANDS MANY OF THEM WHOLLY GIVEN UP TO MAPLES AND WILLOWS
7226-86964-0003 AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
7226-86964-0004 IN THE BOTTOMS THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF BIRDS CROWS HAWKS BLACKBIRDS WITH STATELY BLUE HERONS AND AGILE PLOVERS FORAGING ON THE LONG GRAVEL SPITS WHICH FREQUENTLY JUT FAR INTO THE STREAM
7226-86964-0005 DUCKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN SAILING NEAR THE SHORES WHILE DIVERS SILENTLY DART AND PLUNGE AHEAD OF THE CANOE SAFELY OUT OF GUNSHOT REACH A HEAD WIND THIS MORNING MADE ROWING MORE DIFFICULT BY COUNTERACTING THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT
7226-86964-0006 WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0008 NEAR THE SOUTH BANK THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SWEPT AWAY FOR A SPACE SEVERAL RODS IN WIDTH AND THROUGH THIS OPENING THE PENT UP CURRENT FIERCELY SWEEPS WE WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CHANNEL THUS MADE WITH A SWOOP
7226-86964-0009 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0011 WAS WHITE CLOUD A SHREWD SINISTER SAVAGE HALF WINNEBAGO AND HALF SAC WHO CLAIMED TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BLACK HAWK'S EVIL GENIUS DURING THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AND IN MANY WAYS
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0014 AND IS THICKLY STREWN WITH BOWLDERS MANY OF THEM WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE SURFACE AT THE LOW STAGE OF WATER WHICH WE FOUND BUT FOR THE GREATER PART THEY WERE COVERED FOR TWO OR THREE INCHES WHAT WITH THESE IMPEDIMENTS
7226-86964-0015 THE SNAGS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AS THE LEGACY OF LAST SPRING'S FLOOD AND THE FREQUENT SAND BANKS AND GRAVEL SPITS NAVIGATION WAS ATTENDED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES AND SOME DANGERS FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW PROPHETSTOWN
7226-86964-0016 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0017 HERE THE HIGH BANKS HAD RECEDED WITH SEVERAL MILES OF HEAVILY WOODED BOGGY BOTTOMS INTERVENING FLOODS HAD HELD HIGH CARNIVAL AND THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS WILD AND DESERTED THE CUT OFF WAS AN UGLY LOOKING CHANNEL
7226-86964-0018 BUT WHERE OUR INFORMANT HAD GONE THROUGH WITH HIS UNWIELDY HULK WE CONSIDERED IT SAFE TO VENTURE WITH A CANOE SO READILY RESPONSIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST PADDLE STROKE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0020 THE TWISTED ROOTS THE HUGE BOWLDERS WHICH STUDDED ITS COURSE THE STREAM WAS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE OARS THE PADDLE WAS THE SOLE RELIANCE WITH EYES STRAINED FOR OBSTRUCTIONS WE TURNED AND TWISTED THROUGH THE LABYRINTH
7226-86964-0021 JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7226-86964-0022 THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
7226-86964-0023 AND MADE FOR A THICK CLUMP OF TREES ON THE TOP OF AN ISLAND MUDBANK WHERE WE STOOD BUTTONED TO THE NECK IN RUBBER COATS A VIGOROUS HALLOO CAME SOUNDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING UP WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME A SMALL TENT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
7226-86964-0024 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0026 WHILE THE STORM RAGED WITHOUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A SIMPLE HEARTED FELLOW CONFIDED TO US THE DETAILS OF HIS BRIEF CAREER HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT A YEAR HE SAID HIS LITTLE CABIN LAY A QUARTER OF A MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0027 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0029 HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SMOKING VILE TOBACCO IN A BLACKENED CLAY PIPE IT SEEMED THAT HIS WIFE WAS A FERRYMAN'S DAUGHTER AND HER FATHER HAD BESOUGHT HIS SON IN LAW TO FOLLOW THE SAME STEADY CALLING TO BE SURE OUR HOST DECLARED FERRIES ON THE ROCK RIVER NETTED THEIR OWNERS
7226-86964-0030 WHICH HE CONSIDERED A GOODLY SUM AND HIS FATHER IN LAW HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE AN ESTABLISHED PLANT FOR HIM BUT THE YOUNG FELLOW SAID THAT FERRYING WAS A DOG'S LIFE AND KEPT A FELLER HOME LIKE BARN CHORES
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0032 AND THERE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A STANDING FAMILY QUARREL THE FISHERMAN HAVING APPEALED TO MY JUDGMENT I ENDEAVORED WITH MILD CAUTION TO ARGUE HIM OUT OF HIS POSITION ON THE SCORE OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE AND LITTLE ONE
7226-86964-0033 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0035 BUT AFTER SUPPER ANOTHER SHOWER AND A STIFF HEAD WIND CAME UP AND WE WERE WELL BEDRAGGLED BY THE TIME A FERRY LANDING NEAR THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF ERIE WAS REACHED THE BOTTOMS ARE HERE A MILE OR TWO IN WIDTH WITH OCCASIONAL OPENINGS IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0036 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0037 WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
7226-86964-0038 IT'S SURE WE CAN'T TAKE YE I'D LIKE TO OTHERWISE BUT ERIE'S ONLY A MILE AWAY WE ASSURED HIM THAT WITH THESE MUDDY SWAMP ROADS AND IN OUR WET CONDITION NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD INDUCE US TO TAKE A MILE'S TRAMP THE PARLEY
7226-86964-0039 ENDED IN OUR BEING DIRECTED TO A SMALL FARM HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE INLAND WHERE LUCKLESS TRAVELERS BELATED ON THE DREARY BOTTOMS WERE OCCASIONALLY KEPT MAKING THE CANOE FAST FOR THE NIGHT WE STRUNG OUR BAGGAGE PACKS UPON THE PADDLE WHICH WE CARRIED BETWEEN US
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0041 STANDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE COUNTRY ROAD AMID A CLUMP OF POPLAR TREES FORCING OUR WAY THROUGH THE HINGELESS GATE THE VIOLENT REMOVAL OF WHICH THREATENED THE IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF SEVERAL LENGTHS OF RICKETY FENCE
7226-86964-0042 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS

7226-86964-0045 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0046 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR ON AN EVENING VISIT DECKED OUT IN A SMART JOCKEY CAP WITH A GREEN OSTRICH TIP AND BRIGHT BLUE RIBBONS AND GAY IN A NEW CALICO DRESS
