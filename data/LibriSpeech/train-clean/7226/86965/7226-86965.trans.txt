7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN
7226-86965-0001 WAS A SHORT SMOOTH FACED VOLUBLE OVERGROWN BOY SORT OF MAN THE MOTHER WAS DUMPY COARSE AND GOOD NATURED THEY HAD A GREASY EASY TEMPERED DAUGHTER OF EIGHTEEN WITH A FROWSY HEAD AND A FACE LIKE A FULL MOON
7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0008 AN SO I JINED AN I STUCK HER OUT GEMMEN TILL THE THING WAS DONE THEY AIN'T NO COWARD BOUT ME

7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0016 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0019 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKFAST WE WERE EATING WAS A SPECIAL SPREAD IN HONOR OF PROBABLY THE ONLY GUESTS THE QUONDAM TAVERN HAD HAD THESE MANY MONTHS CANOEISTS MUST NOT BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FARE SET BEFORE THEM BUT ON THIS OCCASION
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0025 WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY TOO MANY OF MY READERS AS THAT TO BE FOUND AT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FARM HOUSE ALTHOUGH WE ALL DOUBTLESS KNOW OF SOME MAGNIFICENT EXCEPTIONS WHICH ONLY PROVE THE RULE WE ESTABLISH PUBLIC COOKING SCHOOLS IN OUR CITIES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0028 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0031 AND MOURNFUL OFTEN GIVING ONE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM CIVILIZATION THREADING THE COURSE OF SOME HITHERTO UNEXPLORED STREAM PENETRATE THE DEEP FRINGE OF FOREST AND MORASS ON FOOT HOWEVER AND SMILING PRAIRIES ARE FOUND BEYOND
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0034 AND THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT THE STREAM HAS OCCASIONALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SUNBAKED BANKS OF ASHY GRAY MUD IN YEARS LONG PAST AT CLEVELAND A STAID LITTLE VILLAGE ON AN OPEN PLAIN WHICH WE REACHED SOON AFTER THE DINNER HOUR
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0037 IDLY ANGLING FROM THE DILAPIDATED APRON ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH CLEVELAND ON THE FAST MAIL FOURTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK IS THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE WITH CARBON CLIFF ON THE NORTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0040 ALSO THAT OWING TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS AND THE LABYRINTH OF CHANNELS BOTH IN THE ROCK AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WE SHOULD FIND IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATTER WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS PROCEED SEVERAL MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0043 AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
