730-359-0000 I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
730-359-0001 WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
730-359-0002 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0003 EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
730-359-0004 AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
730-359-0005 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0006 IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
730-359-0007 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0009 IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
730-359-0010 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0011 THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
730-359-0012 I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
730-359-0013 AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
730-359-0014 THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
730-359-0015 SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
730-359-0016 BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
730-359-0017 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0018 BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
730-359-0019 NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
730-359-0020 AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
730-359-0021 BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0023 AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
730-359-0024 WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
730-359-0025 OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
730-359-0026 AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
730-359-0027 AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
730-359-0028 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0030 IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
730-359-0031 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0033 HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
730-359-0034 THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
730-359-0035 OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
730-359-0036 TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
730-359-0037 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0038 AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
730-359-0039 FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
730-359-0040 AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
730-359-0041 MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
730-359-0042 WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
730-359-0043 AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
730-359-0044 MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
730-359-0045 THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
730-359-0046 I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
730-359-0047 AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
730-359-0048 GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
730-359-0049 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
