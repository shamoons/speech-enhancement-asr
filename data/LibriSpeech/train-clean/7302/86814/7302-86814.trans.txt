7302-86814-0000 IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON
7302-86814-0001 THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
7302-86814-0002 PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY
7302-86814-0003 WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS
7302-86814-0004 THE MEN WHOM JUSTICE HOLDS BENEATH THE STEEL SHE IS SHARPENING THERE CROUCHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WALL WHICH ATTRACTS AND RETAINS THE MOST HEAT THEY MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BUT MORE FREQUENTLY ALONE
7302-86814-0005 WATCHING THE DOOR WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT
7302-86814-0006 IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE
7302-86814-0007 IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE THAN THE BARRIER SAINT JACQUES OR THE GALLEYS
7302-86814-0008 SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR
7302-86814-0009 WERE WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISONER'S TOILET WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST SEE THE PRINCE IS PLUMING HIMSELF SAID ONE OF THE THIEVES HE'S A FINE LOOKING FELLOW SAID ANOTHER

7302-86814-0014 YOU ARE A MAN VOID OF COMPASSION I'LL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT THIS MADE THE KEEPER TURN AROUND AND HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THE PRISONERS THEN APPROACHED AND FORMED A CIRCLE
7302-86814-0015 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
7302-86814-0016 THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING
7302-86814-0017 ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES
7302-86814-0018 ROLLED HIS TONGUE AROUND HIS CHEEKS AND SMACKED HIS LIPS IN A MANNER EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED WORDS AMONG THE BANDITS WHEN FORCED TO BE SILENT IT WAS A MASONIC SIGN CADEROUSSE HAD TAUGHT HIM
7302-86814-0019 HE WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THEM THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS THROWN DOWN AND THE IRON HEELED SHOE REPLACED ON THE FOOT OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM IT BELONGED SOME VOICES WERE HEARD TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT
7302-86814-0020 THAT HE INTENDED TO BE CIVIL IN HIS WAY AND THAT THEY WOULD SET THE EXAMPLE OF LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE MOB RETIRED THE KEEPER WAS SO STUPEFIED AT THIS SCENE THAT HE TOOK ANDREA BY THE HANDS
7302-86814-0021 SAID THE SAME VOICE YOU SEE SOME ONE PAYS ME A VISIT AH MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL SEE WHETHER A CAVALCANTI IS TO BE TREATED LIKE A COMMON PERSON
7302-86814-0022 PROVES ME TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF SOME POWERFUL PERSON THIS SUDDEN FORTUNE THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I HAVE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES AN UNEXPECTED FAMILY AND AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME AWARDED TO ME
7302-86814-0023 GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME AND THE MOST SPLENDID ALLIANCES ABOUT TO BE ENTERED INTO AN UNHAPPY LAPSE OF FORTUNE AND THE ABSENCE OF MY PROTECTOR HAVE CAST ME DOWN CERTAINLY BUT NOT FOREVER
7302-86814-0024 THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR
7302-86814-0025 UPON THE IRON BARS THE BOLTED DOORS AND THE SHADOW WHICH MOVED BEHIND THE OTHER GRATING
