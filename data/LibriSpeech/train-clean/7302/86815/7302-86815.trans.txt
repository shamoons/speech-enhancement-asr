7302-86815-0000 WHICH HAD RESTORED THE COURAGE OF NOIRTIER FOR EVER SINCE HE HAD CONVERSED WITH THE PRIEST HIS VIOLENT DESPAIR HAD YIELDED TO A CALM RESIGNATION WHICH SURPRISED ALL WHO KNEW HIS EXCESSIVE AFFECTION
7302-86815-0001 HAD NOT SEEN HIS FATHER SINCE THE MORNING OF THE DEATH THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CHANGED ANOTHER VALET WAS ENGAGED FOR HIMSELF
7302-86815-0002 TWO WOMEN HAD ENTERED MADAME DE VILLEFORT'S SERVICE IN FACT EVERYWHERE TO THE CONCIERGE AND COACHMEN NEW FACES WERE PRESENTED TO THE DIFFERENT MASTERS OF THE HOUSE
7302-86815-0003 THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY SLAVE ON HIS DEATH BED AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE
7302-86815-0004 IN ACCUSING HIS COMPANION BUT THE MIND OF THE PROCUREUR WAS MADE UP HE FELT ASSURED THAT BENEDETTO WAS GUILTY AND HE HOPED BY HIS SKILL IN CONDUCTING THIS AGGRAVATED CASE TO FLATTER HIS SELF LOVE
7302-86815-0005 WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY VULNERABLE POINT LEFT IN HIS FROZEN HEART THE CASE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED OWING TO THE INCESSANT LABOR
7302-86815-0006 WHO WISHED IT TO BE THE FIRST ON THE LIST IN THE COMING ASSIZES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SECLUDE HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER TO EVADE THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS
7302-86815-0007 PRESENTED TO HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO THE COURT ON THE DAY OF TRIAL
7302-86815-0008 AND THE GLOOM WHICH OVERSHADOWED THE HOUSE WAS SO RECENT
7302-86815-0009 WHICH WERE THE ONLY MEANS HE HAD OF DISSIPATING HIS GRIEF ONCE ONLY HAD VILLEFORT SEEN HIS FATHER
7302-86815-0010 WHEN THE LATTER WAS TO LEARN HIS FATHER'S NAME THE MAGISTRATE HARASSED AND FATIGUED
7302-86815-0011 SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH TARQUIN LOPPED OFF THE TALLEST POPPIES HE BEGAN KNOCKING OFF WITH HIS CANE THE LONG AND DYING BRANCHES OF THE ROSE TREES WHICH PLACED ALONG THE AVENUE
7302-86815-0012 AT ONE OF THE OPEN WINDOWS
7302-86815-0013 WHICH VILLEFORT COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH HIS GLANCE WAS SO FULL OF HATE OF FEROCITY AND SAVAGE IMPATIENCE
7302-86815-0014 TO SEE UPON WHAT PERSON THIS DARK LOOK WAS DIRECTED THEN HE SAW BENEATH A THICK CLUMP OF LINDEN TREES WHICH WERE NEARLY DIVESTED OF FOLIAGE MADAME DE VILLEFORT SITTING WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND
7302-86815-0015 TO SMILE UPON HER SON OR TO THROW BACK HIS ELASTIC BALL WHICH HE OBSTINATELY THREW FROM THE DRAWING ROOM INTO THE GARDEN
7302-86815-0016 HOWEVER AT LENGTH HE DECIDED LEAPED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A CLUSTER OF HELIOTROPES AND DAISIES AND RAN TO HIS MOTHER HIS FOREHEAD STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION
7302-86815-0017 PRESSED HER LIPS UPON IT AND SENT HIM BACK WITH THE BALL IN ONE HAND AND SOME BONBONS IN THE OTHER
7302-86815-0018 LIKE THAT OF THE BIRD TO THE SERPENT WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AS HE APPROACHED IT
7302-86815-0019 FELT THEM PIERCE TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART IN THAT EARNEST LOOK
7302-86815-0020 AS WELL AS A TERRIBLE MENACE THEN NOIRTIER RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN
7302-86815-0021 IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
7302-86815-0022 AND TURNED HIS EYES WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER SIDE
7302-86815-0023 WHICH SEEMED TO STRANGLE HIM AND PASSING HIS LIVID HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD ENTERED HIS STUDY THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STILL THE FAMILY HAD ALL RETIRED TO REST BUT VILLEFORT WHO ALONE REMAINED UP
7302-86815-0024 HE HAD TRACED IN RED INK THE MAGISTRATE HAD SLEPT FOR A SHORT TIME WHILE THE LAMP SENT FORTH ITS FINAL STRUGGLES ITS FLICKERINGS AWOKE HIM AND HE FOUND HIS FINGERS AS DAMP AND PURPLE AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN BLOOD
7302-86815-0025 WHICH STOOD OUT IN BLACK RELIEF ON THE HORIZON IN THE CLOVER FIELDS BEYOND THE CHESTNUT TREES A LARK WAS MOUNTING UP TO HEAVEN WHILE POURING OUT HER CLEAR MORNING SONG
7302-86815-0026 AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY TO DAY HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT TO DAY THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE BLADE OF JUSTICE MUST STRIKE WHEREVER THERE IS GUILT INVOLUNTARILY HIS EYES WANDERED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
7302-86815-0027 OF NOIRTIER'S ROOM WHERE HE HAD SEEN HIM THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN AND YET THE IMAGE OF HIS FATHER WAS SO VIVID TO HIS MIND THAT HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSED WINDOW AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OPEN
7302-86815-0028 AND AS IF THROUGH THE OPENING HE HAD BEHELD THE MENACING OLD MAN YES HE MURMURED YES BE SATISFIED HIS HEAD DROPPED UPON HIS CHEST AND IN THIS POSITION HE PACED HIS STUDY
7302-86815-0029 THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON A SOFA LESS TO SLEEP THAN TO REST HIS LIMBS CRAMPED WITH COLD AND STUDY BY DEGREES EVERY ONE AWOKE
