7402-59171-0000 MISTER SHAW CAME FOR A SHORT TIME RECENTLY TO BE REGARDED LESS AS AN AUTHOR THAN AS AN INCIDENT IN THE EUROPEAN WAR IN THE OPINION OF MANY PEOPLE IT SEEMED AS IF THE ALLIES WERE FIGHTING AGAINST A COMBINATION COMPOSED OF GERMANY
7402-59171-0001 AND HE DOES EXPRESS AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING WITHOUT MAKING A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE SHAKE THEIR FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER HIS LIFE AT LEAST HIS PUBLIC LIFE
7402-59171-0002 HE HAS GONE ABOUT LIKE A PICKPOCKET OF ILLUSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF LITERATURE TO THE WORLD OF MORALS AND FROM THE WORLD OF MORALS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS AND EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE AN INNUMERABLE GROWL HAS FOLLOWED HIM
7402-59171-0003 NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
7402-59171-0004 BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
7402-59171-0005 SEEMS LIKE LIFE IN RUINS ARE FILLED AT TIMES WITH A WILD LUST TO DENOUNCE AND BELITTLE HIM HE HAS BEEN CALLED MORE NAMES THAN ANY OTHER MAN OF LETTERS ALIVE
7402-59171-0006 WHEN ALL THE OTHER NAMES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND WE ARE ABOUT TO BECOME INARTICULATE WE EVEN DENOUNCE HIM AS A BORE BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BILLINGSGATE OF OUR EXASPERATION MISTER SHAW IS NOT A BORE
7402-59171-0007 WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
7402-59171-0008 PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
7402-59171-0009 IN SEARCH OF A GHOST WITH ITS BEARD ON FIRE HIS CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSE HIM IN REGARD TO THE INVENTION OF THE SHAW MYTH OF HAVING DESIGNED A POSTER RATHER THAN PAINTED A PORTRAIT
7402-59171-0010 STOP ADVERTISING MYSELF ON THE CONTRARY I MUST DO IT MORE THAN EVER LOOK AT PEARS'S SOAP THERE IS A SOLID HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT EVERY WALL IS STILL PLASTERED WITH THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS IF I WERE TO GIVE UP ADVERTISING
7402-59171-0011 MY BUSINESS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO FALL OFF YOU BLAME ME FOR HAVING DECLARED MYSELF TO BE THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN OF MY TIME BUT THE CLAIM IS AN ARGUABLE ONE WHY SHOULD I NOT SAY IT WHEN I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE
7402-59171-0012 HE IS IN THE LINE OF ALL THOSE TRAMPS AND STAGE IRISHMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LIFE WITH SO FINE A SWAGGER OF WORDS THIS ONLY MEANS THAT IN HIS LIFE HE IS AN ARTIST
7402-59171-0013 UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT HE IS AN ARTIST NOT ONLY IN THE INVENTION OF HIS OWN LIFE BUT IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE HIS BROADBENT IS AS WONDERFUL A FIGURE AS HIS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW NOT THAT HIS PORTRAITURE IS ALWAYS FAITHFUL
7402-59171-0014 HE SEES MEN AND WOMEN TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE REFRACTING SHALLOWS OF THEORIES HE IS A DOCTRINAIRE AND HIS CHARACTERS ARE OFTEN COMIC STATEMENTS OF HIS DOCTRINES RATHER THAN THE REFLECTIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN
7402-59171-0015 HE OBSERVES IN ONE OF THE MANY PASSAGES IN WHICH HE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF THE AUDIENCE THINKS IT IS BEING MADE FUN OF IN REALITY I AM SIMPLY A VERY CAREFUL WRITER OF NATURAL HISTORY
7402-59171-0016 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0017 RATHER WHEN HE IS PRESENTING A QUEER FIZZING MIXTURE OF HUMAN NATURE AND HIS OPINIONS ABOUT IT THIS MAY BE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY A VIRTUE IN HIS COMEDY CERTAINLY FROM THE TIME OF ARISTOPHANES ONWARDS
7402-59171-0018 ADMIRABLY TRUE BOTH TO HUMAN NATURE AND TO MISTER SHAW'S VIEW OF THE HUMAN NATURE OF ARTISTS BUT WHEN HE GOES ON WITH HIS LAST BREATH TO UTTER HIS ARTISTIC CREED I BELIEVE IN MICHAEL ANGELO VELASQUEZ AND REMBRANDT IN THE MIGHT OF DESIGN
7402-59171-0019 THE REDEMPTION OF ALL THINGS BY BEAUTY EVERLASTING AND THE MESSAGE OF ART THAT HAS MADE THESE HANDS BLESSED AMEN AMEN THESE SENTENCES ARE NO MORE NATURAL OR NATURALISTIC
7402-59171-0020 WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF HUMANITY REPEATING MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE CREED OF ARTISTS THERE IS A SIMILAR FALSIFICATION IN THE SAME PLAY IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO IS PRESENT AT DUBEDAT'S DEATH
7402-59171-0021 BECAUSE INTO AN ATMOSPHERE OF MORE OR LESS NATURALISTIC COMEDY THEY SIMPLY INTRODUCE A FARCICAL EXAGGERATION OF MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE INCOMPETENCE AND IMPUDENCE OF JOURNALISTS MISTER SHAW'S COMEDIES ARE REPEATEDLY INJURED
7402-59171-0022 BY A HURRIED ALTERATION OF ATMOSPHERE IN THIS MANNER COMEDY AS WELL AS TRAGEDY MUST CREATE SOME KIND OF ILLUSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ILLUSION EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF A JOKE MAY MEAN THE DESTRUCTION OF LAUGHTER
7402-59171-0023 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0024 THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF B B THE SOOTHING AND INCOMPETENT DOCTOR IS A CREATION OF THE TRUE COMIC GENIUS NINE PEOPLE OUT OF TEN HARP ON MISTER SHAW'S ERRORS
7402-59171-0025 IT IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AMID ALL HIS FALSIFICATIONS DOCTRINAL AND JOCULAR HE HAS A GENUINE COMIC SENSE OF CHARACTER MOST FRENCH CRITICS
7402-59171-0026 DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
7402-59171-0027 MOLIERE HAS NEVER DRAWN A DOCTOR MORE COMICALLY THE DOCTOR THAN PARAMORE NOR MORE CHARACTERISTIC FIGURES OF WOMEN THAN THOSE IN THE SAME PLAY THE PHILANDERER THE CHARACTER DRAWING IS ADMIRABLE
7402-59171-0028 AND THE CHARACTERIZATION IN MOLIERE IN SHAW'S PLAYS THE CHARACTERS ARE LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF VICES OR PASSIONS THAN THOSE OF MOLIERE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF CLASS PROFESSION OR SECT
7402-59171-0029 MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
7402-59171-0030 A FEW ONLY OF THESE LATTER TYPES ARE GIVEN US BY MOLIERE
7402-59171-0031 OF FARCE AND SO FORTH IS A SUGGESTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO CRITICISM I AM NOT SURE THAT THE COMPARISON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY PUT IN A CHAPTER THAN A BOOK
7402-59171-0032 IS INTENDED AS A BIOGRAPHY AND GENERAL CRITICISM OF MISTER SHAW AS WELL AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN HIS WORK AND MOLIERE'S IT CONTAINS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A GREAT DEAL THAT IS NOT NEW TO ENGLISH READERS
7402-59171-0033 MISTER SHAW IS MADE AN IDOL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
7402-59171-0034 IS AN OFFERING AT A SHRINE THE TRUE THINGS IT CONTAINS HOWEVER MAKE IT WORTH READING
7402-59171-0035 FOR INSTANCE WHAT MANY CRITICS HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT IN HIS DRAMATIC WORK MISTER SHAW IS LESS A WIT THAN A HUMORIST IN SHAW'S WORK WE FIND FEW STUDIED JESTS FEW EPIGRAMS EVEN
7402-59171-0036 MOLIERE ANTICIPATED MISTER SHAW IN OUTRAGING THE SENTIMENT FOR INSTANCE WHICH HAS GATHERED ROUND THE FAMILY MOLIERE AND SHAW AS HE PUTS IT WITH QUAINT SERIOUSNESS APPEAR TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT A FATHER IS WHAT A FATHER IS WORTH
7402-59171-0037 THE DEFENCE OF MISTER SHAW HOWEVER DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY REAL OR IMAGINARY RESEMBLANCE OF HIS PLAYS TO MOLIERE'S HIS JOY AND HIS MISERY BEFORE THE LUDICROUS SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE ARE HIS OWN AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THEM
7402-59171-0038 IS HIS OWN HE HAS STUDIED WITH HIS OWN EYES THE SWOLLEN BELLIED PRETENCES OF PREACHERS AND POETS AND RICH MEN AND LOVERS AND POLITICIANS AND HE HAS DERIDED THEM AS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DERIDED ON THE ENGLISH STAGE BEFORE
7402-59171-0039 HE HAS DERIDED THEM WITH BOTH AN ARTISTIC AND A MORAL ENERGY HE HAS BROUGHT THEM ALL INTO A PALACE OF TRUTH WHERE THEY HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED AND STARTLING FRANKNESS
7402-59171-0040 HE HAS DONE THIS SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE EXUBERANCE OF MIRTH SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF A SATIRIST EVEN HIS BITTERNESS IS NEVER VENOMOUS HOWEVER HE IS GENIAL BEYOND THE MAJORITY OF INVETERATE CONTROVERSIALISTS AND PROPAGANDISTS
7402-59171-0041 HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
7402-59171-0042 BECAUSE IT IS FROM AN ORTHODOX POINT OF VIEW GENIALITY IN THE WRONG PLACE IT IS LIKE A GRIN IN CHURCH A LAUGH AT A MARRIAGE SERVICE
7402-59171-0043 THAT HE WAS NOT INTENSELY SERIOUS IN ALL THAT HE WROTE ABOUT THE WAR BUT HIS SERIOUSNESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SERIOUSNESS OF IN THE HIGHER SENSE OF THE WORD THE COMIC ARTIST OF THE DISILLUSIONIST
7402-59171-0044 HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
7402-59171-0045 THOUGH HIS ATTITUDE TO THE WAR WAS AS ANTI PRUSSIAN
7402-59171-0046 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A PRO GERMAN THE FACT IS IN WAR TIME MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME PEOPLE DREAD THE VISION OF THE SATIRIST AND THE SCEPTIC
7402-59171-0047 THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE MISTER SHAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION OF POLITICS THAT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN BRILLIANT CHALLENGING AND HUMANE AND NOT MORE WAYWARD THAN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PARTISAN
7402-59171-0048 IT MAY BE SAID OF MISTER SHAW THAT IN HIS POLITICS AS IN HIS PLAYS HE HAS SOUGHT UTOPIA ALONG THE PATH OF DISILLUSION AS OTHER MEN HAVE SOUGHT IT ALONG THE PATH OF IDEALISM
