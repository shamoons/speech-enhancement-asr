7447-91187-0000 THE PIANO BARD THE PIANO RHAPSODIST THE PIANO MIND THE PIANO SOUL IS CHOPIN SAID RUBINSTEIN TRAGIC ROMANTIC LYRIC HEROIC DRAMATIC FANTASTIC SOULFUL
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0003 WHO EXPLORED THE HARMONIC VASTNESS OF THE PIANOFORTE AND MADE HIS OWN ALL ITS MYSTIC SECRETS BORN AND BRED ON POLAND'S SOIL SON OF A FRENCH FATHER AND A POLISH MOTHER FREDERIC CHOPIN
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0009 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0012 AND ENDOWED IT WITH A WARMTH OF TONE COLORING THAT SPIRITUALIZED IT FOR ALL TIME TO THE PIANO HE CONFIDED ALL THE CONFLICTS THAT RAGED WITHIN HIM ALL THE COURAGE AND LIVING HOPE THAT SUSTAINED HIM
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0015 ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0018 WHAT UHLAND WAS TO THE GERMANS HE ONCE SAID TO A FRIEND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE AND IMMORTALIZED ITS JOYS SORROWS AND CAPRICES BY THE FORCE OF HIS SPLENDID ART
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0021 THAT UPLIFTS AND STRENGTHENS THE TRAVAILING SOUL IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD A SAD HEART BUT A JOYFUL MIND THE TWO TEACHERS OF CHOPIN WERE
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0024 HE RESPECTED THEM BOTH A REVERING AFFECTION WAS CHERISHED BY HIM FOR ELSNER TO WHOM HE OWED HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS ART HIS HABITS OF SERIOUS STUDY
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0030 THE MOST UNACCUSTOMED OF HIS COMPLICATED CHROMATIC MODULATIONS WE CAN FEEL HIS INDIVIDUALITY PULSATING THROUGH EVERY TONE EVOKED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED FINGERS OF HIS AS THEY WEAVE MEASURES FOR SYLPHS
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0039 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0042 WERE DEMANDED BY HIM INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THE FINGERS WAS ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS AND HE BELIEVED IN ASSIGNING TO EACH OF THEM ITS APPROPRIATE PART IN A GOOD MECHANISM HE SAID
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0051 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0054 SERENELY FANCYING THEY ARE HEEDING THE MASTER'S DESIGN RECKLESS OUT OF TIME PLAYING DISFIGURES WHAT IS MEANT TO EXPRESS THE FLUCTUATION OF THOUGHT THE SOUL'S AGITATION THE ROLLING OF THE WAVES OF TIME AND ETERNITY
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0056 INDICATIONS OF IT IN BACH ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BEETHOVEN USED IT EFFECTIVELY CHOPIN APPROPRIATED IT AS ONE OF HIS MOST POTENT AUXILIARIES IN PLAYING HE EMPHASIZED THE SAYING OF MOZART
7447-91187-0057 ITS LEAVES TREMBLE WITH EVERY BREATH OF THE WIND BUT THE TREE REMAINS UNSHAKEN THAT IS THE RUBATO THERE ARE STORMS TO WHICH EVEN THE TREE YIELDS TO REALIZE THEM TO DIVINE THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE UNDULATING TEMPEST TOSSED RUBATO
7447-91187-0058 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0059 CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0060 SPIRITUALIZING ITS TIMBRE LIBERATING IT FROM TRADITIONAL ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL EFFECTS AND ELEVATING IT TO AN INDEPENDENT POWER IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC BESIDES ENRICHING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PIANO HE AUGMENTED THE MATERIALS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION
7447-91187-0061 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7447-91187-0063 BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
7447-91187-0064 DISCUSSING THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHOPIN IN HIS DELIGHTFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK CHOPIN THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC CALLS THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS
7447-91187-0065 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0066 FAERY DRAMAS THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE THE VALSES AND MAZURKAS
7447-91187-0067 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7447-91187-0069 THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
