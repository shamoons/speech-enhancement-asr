7517-100429-0000 THE POND MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S POND STANDS AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND IS REACHED BY A WELL DRAINED GRAVEL PATH SO THAT IN ANY WEATHER ONE MAY WALK
7517-100429-0001 ALONE OR IN COMPANY DRY SHOD TO ITS BRINK AND ESTIMATE ROUGHLY HOW MANY INCHES OF RAIN HAVE FALLEN IN THE NIGHT THE RIBALD CALL IT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS POND TRACING
7517-100429-0002 A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE BATH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AT THE ZOO BENEATH THE WATERS OF WHICH IF YOU PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO POINT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS OUT TO SOMEBODY HE ALWAYS LIES HIDDEN TO THE REST OF US
7517-100429-0003 IT IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE POND A DESIGNATION WHICH IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL NEIGHBOURING PONDS THE GIFTS OF NATURE AND GIVES THE WHOLE CREDIT TO THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
7517-100429-0004 FOR THE POND IS JUST A SMALL ARTIFICIAL AFFAIR OF CEMENT ENTIRELY UNPRETENTIOUS THERE ARE SEVEN STEPS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND AND EACH STEP
7517-100429-0005 THUS THE STEPS HELP TO MAKE THE POND A CONVENIENT RAIN GAUGE FOR OBVIOUSLY WHEN ONLY THREE STEPS ARE LEFT UNCOVERED AS WAS THE CASE LAST MONDAY
7517-100429-0006 WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
7517-100429-0007 DRAINS SECRETLY INTO THE POND TOO THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE A MUCH FAIRER INDICATION OF THE RAIN THAT HAS FALLEN THAN DO THE OFFICIAL FIGURES IN THE NEWSPAPERS
7517-100429-0008 FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
7517-100429-0009 HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
7517-100429-0010 SOOTHES US WHERE THE RECORD OF THE ORDINARY PEDANTIC RAIN GAUGE WOULD LEAVE US INFURIATED IT SPEAKS MUCH FOR MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S BREADTH OF VIEW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THIS
7517-100429-0011 AND PLANNED THE POND ACCORDINGLY A MOST NECESSARY THING IN A COUNTRY HOUSE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECOGNIZED MEETING PLACE
7517-100429-0012 WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRITING A FEW LETTERS AFTER BREAKFAST MAY WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED MEET THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF WRITING ANY AND ARRANGE PLANS WITH THEM FOR THE MORNING
7517-100429-0013 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO CANNOT WRITE LETTERS IN ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE AND WHEN MY PIPE IS WELL ALIGHT I SAY TO MISS ROBINSON OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE POND
7517-100429-0014 RIGHT OH SHE SAYS WILLINGLY ENOUGH HAVING SPENT THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH THE TIMES FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT ALL OF THE PAPER THAT IS LEFT TO THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST RUSH FOR THE CRICKET NEWS
7517-100429-0015 WE WANDER DOWN TO THE POND TOGETHER AND PERHAPS FIND BROWN AND MISS SMITH THERE A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT SAYS BROWN IT WAS ONLY JUST OVER THE THIRD STEP AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY
7517-100429-0016 WE HAVE A LITTLE ARGUMENT ABOUT IT MISS ROBINSON BEING CONVINCED THAT SHE STOOD ON THE SECOND STEP AFTER BREAKFAST AND MISS SMITH REPEATING THAT IT LOOKS
7517-100429-0017 BY AND BY TWO OR THREE OTHERS STROLL UP AND WE ALL MAKE MEASUREMENTS TOGETHER THE GENERAL OPINION IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT
7517-100429-0018 MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
7517-100429-0019 AND THEY CAN BE MADE MORE READILY OUT OF DOORS FOR SUPPOSING IT IS FINE THE FRESH AIR CALLS YOU TO BE DOING SOMETHING AND THE SIGHT OF THE NEWLY MARKED TENNIS LAWN
7517-100429-0020 FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS
7517-100429-0021 TO BE DISINCLINED TO LEAVE IT TILL LUNCH TIME A MAN OR WOMAN AS LAZY AS THIS MUST NOT BE RUSHED SAY TO SUCH A ONE COME AND PLAY AND THE INVITATION
7517-100429-0022 WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
7517-100429-0023 ALL THIS FOR THOSE DELIGHTFUL SUMMER DAYS WHEN THERE ARE FINE INTERVALS BUT CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF THE POND WHEN THE RAIN STREAMS DOWN IN TORRENTS
7517-100429-0024 FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HOW TIRED WE GET OF BEING INDOORS ON THESE DAYS EVEN WITH THE BEST OF BOOKS THE PLEASANTEST OF COMPANIONS THE EASIEST OF BILLIARD TABLES
7517-100429-0025 YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
7517-100429-0026 ER I WAS JUST GOING TO ER WALK ABOUT A BIT BUT NOW WE TELL HER BRIGHTLY I'M GOING TO SEE THE POND IT MUST BE NEARLY FULL WON'T YOU COME TOO AND WITH ANY LUCK SHE COMES
7517-100429-0027 TO THESE STREAMING DAYS TO REFLECT THAT IT ALL GOES TO FILL THE POND FOR THERE IS EVER BEFORE OUR MINDS THAT GREAT MOMENT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE POND IS AT LAST FULL
7517-100429-0028 WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN ALDENHAM MAY KNOW BUT WE HIS GUESTS DO NOT SOME THINK THERE WILL BE MERELY A FLOOD OVER THE SURROUNDING PATHS AND THE KITCHEN GARDEN BUT FOR MYSELF
7517-100429-0029 I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROMISED SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A BROAD AND FRIENDLY OUTLOOK TOWARDS RAIN GAUGES WILL BE SURE TO ARRANGE SOMETHING STRIKING WHEN THE GREAT MOMENT ARRIVES
7517-100429-0030 WILL HELP TO CELEBRATE IT I HAVE NO DOUBT WITH AN OPEN AIR PLAY TANK DRAMA OR WHAT NOT AT ANY RATE WE HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL EMPTY THE POND AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
7517-100429-0031 SO THAT WE MAY WATCH IT FILL AGAIN I MUST SAY THAT HE HAS BEEN A LITTLE LUCKY IN HIS CHOICE OF A YEAR FOR INAUGURATING THE POND BUT ALL THE SAME
7517-100429-0032 HAVE FALLEN IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
