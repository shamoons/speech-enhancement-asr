7517-100437-0000 A HOUSEHOLD BOOK ONCE ON A TIME I DISCOVERED SAMUEL BUTLER NOT THE OTHER TWO BUT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE WAY OF ALL FLESH THE SECOND BEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
7517-100437-0001 I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
7517-100437-0002 WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
7517-100437-0003 IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
7517-100437-0004 WHO WROTE IN THE EARLY PART OF LAST CENTURY A BOOK CALLED
7517-100437-0005 MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
7517-100437-0006 BUT I DARE NOT RISK IT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR SCORN AT MY PREVIOUS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TILLIER YOUR AMUSED CONTEMPT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED
7517-100437-0007 IN BORROWING THE CLASSIC UPON WHICH YOU WERE BROUGHT UP THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0008 WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF CLAUDE TILLIER
7517-100437-0009 WHO HAS NOT READ IT IN FRENCH OR AS I DID IN AMERICAN LET US PASS ON TO ANOTHER BOOK FOR I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER DISCOVERY
7517-100437-0010 OF A BOOK WHICH SHOULD BE A CLASSIC BUT IS NOT OF A BOOK OF WHICH NOBODY HAS HEARD UNLESS THROUGH ME IT WAS PUBLISHED SOME TWELVE YEARS AGO THE LAST PUBLISHED BOOK
7517-100437-0011 OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER WHEN I TELL YOU HIS NAME YOU WILL SAY OH YES I LOVE HIS BOOKS AND YOU WILL MENTION SO AND SO AND ITS EQUALLY FAMOUS SEQUEL SUCH AND SUCH
7517-100437-0012 BUT WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE READ MY BOOK YOU WILL PROFESS SURPRISE AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT IS IT AS GOOD AS SO AND SO AND SUCH AND SUCH YOU WILL ASK
7517-100437-0013 HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE MUCH BETTER I SHALL REPLY AND THERE IF THESE THINGS WERE ARRANGED PROPERLY WOULD BE ANOTHER TEN PER CENT IN MY POCKET BUT BELIEVE ME
7517-100437-0014 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7517-100437-0015 ARE THE GOLDEN AGE AND DREAM DAYS AM I NOT RIGHT THANK YOU BUT THE BOOK YOU HAVE NOT READ MY BOOK
7517-100437-0016 THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS AM I NOT RIGHT AGAIN AH I WAS AFRAID SO THE REASON WHY I KNEW YOU HAD NOT READ IT IS THE REASON WHY I CALL IT MY BOOK
7517-100437-0017 FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING IT USUALLY I SPEAK ABOUT IT AT MY FIRST MEETING WITH A STRANGER IT IS MY OPENING REMARK JUST AS YOURS IS SOMETHING FUTILE ABOUT THE WEATHER
7517-100437-0018 IF I DON'T GET IT IN AT THE BEGINNING I SQUEEZE IT IN AT THE END THE STRANGER HAS GOT TO HAVE IT SOME TIME SHOULD I EVER FIND MYSELF IN THE DOCK AND ONE NEVER KNOWS
7517-100437-0019 MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHETHER I HAD ANYTHING TO SAY WOULD BE WELL MY LORD IF I MIGHT JUST RECOMMEND A BOOK TO THE JURY BEFORE LEAVING MISTER JUSTICE DARLING
7517-100437-0020 WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
7517-100437-0021 WHETHER IT IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT IT IS THE AMAZING TRUTH THAT NONE OF THOSE HUNDREDS HAD HEARD OF THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS UNTIL I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0022 SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
7517-100437-0023 GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS TWO EARLIER FAMOUS BOOKS BUT IGNORANT THEREAFTER I HAD THEIR PROMISE BEFORE THEY LEFT ME AND WAITED CONFIDENTLY
7517-100437-0024 FOR THEIR GRATITUDE NO DOUBT THEY ALSO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS IN THEIR TURN AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT REACHED YOU IN THIS WAY BUT IT WAS TO ME
7517-100437-0025 NONE THE LESS THAT YOUR THANKS WERE DUE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A COUPLE OF CASUAL REFERENCES TO IT AS IF IT WERE A CLASSIC KNOWN TO ALL IN A FAMOUS NOVEL
7517-100437-0026 PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IT WAS I WHO INTRODUCED THAT NOVELIST TO IT SIX MONTHS BEFORE INDEED I FEEL SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS I WHO WROTE THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS
7517-100437-0027 AND RECOMMENDED IT TO KENNETH GRAHAME BUT PERHAPS I AM WRONG HERE FOR I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY LAMENTED AM I FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN ITS SALE
7517-100437-0028 AN EXPLANATION WHICH SUSPICIOUS STRANGERS REQUIRE FROM ME SOMETIMES I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE BOOK FOR NO DESCRIPTION WOULD HELP IT BUT I SHALL JUST SAY THIS
7517-100437-0029 THAT IT IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEHOLD BOOK BY A HOUSEHOLD BOOK I MEAN A BOOK WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD LOVES AND QUOTES CONTINUALLY EVER AFTERWARDS A BOOK WHICH IS READ ALOUD
7517-100437-0030 TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
7517-100437-0031 WHO REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND THAT THE OTHERS ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OF IT IT IS OBVIOUS YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING OF YOU
7517-100437-0032 WHEN HE WROTE IT I HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE JONES WERE HIS FINAL WORDS AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN WELL OF COURSE YOU WILL ORDER THE BOOK AT ONCE
7517-100437-0033 BUT I MUST GIVE YOU ONE WORD OF WARNING WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO IT DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS AS TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY TASTE
7517-100437-0034 STILL LESS ON THE GENIUS OF KENNETH GRAHAME YOU ARE MERELY SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON YOURSELF YOU MAY BE WORTHY I DO NOT KNOW
