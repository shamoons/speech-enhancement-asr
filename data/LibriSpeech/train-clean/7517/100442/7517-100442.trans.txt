7517-100442-0000 AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
7517-100442-0001 BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
7517-100442-0002 AT ONE MOMENT TO WALK UP A LADDER IN SEARCH OF NUTMEG AT THE NEXT TO DIVE UNDER A COUNTER IN PURSUIT OF CINNAMON TO SERVE LITTLE GIRLS
7517-100442-0003 AND LORDLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WITH A PINT OF CHERRY GIN IS NOT THIS TO FOLLOW THE KING OF TRADES SOME DAY I SHALL OPEN A GROCER'S SHOP AND YOU WILL FIND ME IN MY SPARE EVENINGS
7517-100442-0004 APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
7517-100442-0005 WE GROCERS ONLY PUT THE CURRANTS OUT FOR SHOW AND SO THAT WE MAY RUN OUR FINGERS THROUGH THEM LUXURIOUSLY WHEN BUSINESS IS SLACK I HAVE A GOOD LINE IN SHORTBREADS MADAM IF I CAN FIND THE BOX
7517-100442-0006 BUT NO CURRANTS THIS EVENING I BEG YOU YES TO BE A GROCER IS TO LIVE WELL BUT AFTER ALL IT IS NOT TO SEE LIFE A GROCER
7517-100442-0007 IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
7517-100442-0008 AND TO SELL A MAN POTTED LOBSTER IS NOT TO HAVE OUR FINGERS ON HIS PULSE POTTED LOBSTER DOES NOT DEFINE A MAN ALL CUSTOMERS ARE ALIKE TO THE GROCER PROVIDED THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
7517-100442-0009 I PERCEIVE NOW THAT I WAS OVER HASTY IN DECIDING TO BECOME A GROCER THAT IS RATHER FOR ONE'S OLD AGE WHILE ONE IS YOUNG AND INTERESTED IN PERSONS RATHER THAN IN THINGS
7517-100442-0010 THERE IS ONLY ONE PROFESSION TO FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF BOOKSTALL CLERK TO BE BEHIND A BOOKSTALL IS INDEED TO SEE LIFE THE FASCINATION OF IT STRUCK ME SUDDENLY
7517-100442-0011 LAST MONDAY AND WONDERED WHO BOUGHT THE TIE CLIPS THE ANSWER CAME TO ME JUST AS I GOT INTO MY TRAIN ASK THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL HE WOULD KNOW
7517-100442-0012 YES AND HE WOULD KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL HIS PAPERS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS AND TO KNOW THIS IS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
7517-100442-0013 YOU CANNOT TELL A MAN BY THE LOBSTER HE EATS BUT YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BY THE LITERATURE HE READS FOR INSTANCE I ONCE OCCUPIED A CARRIAGE ON AN EASTERN LINE
7517-100442-0014 WITH AMONG OTHERS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AS SOON AS WE LEFT LIVERPOOL STREET SHE PRODUCED A BAG OF SHRIMPS GRASPED EACH INDIVIDUAL IN TURN FIRMLY BY THE HEAD AND TAIL
7517-100442-0015 AND ATE HIM WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE EMPTIED THE ENDS OUT OF THE WINDOW WIPED HER HANDS AND SETTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY TO HER PAPER WHAT PAPER YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
7517-100442-0016 I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
7517-100442-0017 CONCEIVE THE HOLY JOY OF THE BOOKSTALL CLERK AS SHE AND HER BAG OF SHRIMPS YES HE COULD HAVE TOLD AT ONCE THEY WERE SHRIMPS APPROACHED AND ASKED FOR THE MORNING POST
7517-100442-0018 THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
7517-100442-0019 HE WANTS CAGE BIRDS THAT ONE OVER THERE WANTS THE MOTOR AH WELL THE AUTO CAR THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH SOON HE WOULD BEGIN TO KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES HE WOULD LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
7517-100442-0020 BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
7517-100442-0021 A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
7517-100442-0022 AND THEY WOULD BE VERY RARE HIS FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WOULD BEGIN TO OOZE AWAY UNTIL ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD TELL HIMSELF EXCITEDLY THAT THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL IN DISGUISE
7517-100442-0023 RATHER OVERDOING THE PART AFTER WHICH HE WOULD HAND OVER THE WINNING POST AND THE ANIMALS FRIEND TO THE PURSUING DETECTIVE IN A SORT OF HOLY AWE WHAT A LIFE
7517-100442-0024 BUT HE HAS OTHER THINGS THAN PAPERS TO SELL HE KNOWS WHO BUYS THOSE LITTLE SIXPENNY BOOKS OF FUNNY STORIES A PROBLEM WHICH HAS OFTEN PUZZLED US OTHERS
7517-100442-0025 HE UNDERSTANDS BY NOW THE TYPE OF MAN WHO WANTS TO READ UP A FEW GOOD JOKES TO TELL THEM DOWN AT OLD ROBINSON'S WHERE HE IS GOING FOR THE WEEK END OUR BOOKSTALL CLERK DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED
7517-100442-0026 AS SOON AS THIS GENTLEMAN APPROACHES HE WHIPS OUT THE BOOK DUSTS IT AND PLACES IT BEFORE THE RACONTEUR HE RECOGNIZES ALSO AT A GLANCE THE SORT OF SILLY ASS
7517-100442-0027 WHO IS ALWAYS LOSING HIS INDIARUBBER UMBRELLA RING HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATION HE CAN SEE HIM AND HE HASTENS TO GET A NEW CARD OUT IN READINESS OR WE WOULD LET YOU HAVE SEVEN FOR SIXPENCE SIR
7517-100442-0028 AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
7517-100442-0029 OF MAJOR GENERAL CLEMENT BULGER C B EVEN THEN THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL IS NOT FOUND WANTING IF HE IS WRONG THE FIRST TIME HE NEVER FAILS TO RECOVER WITH HIS SECOND BULGER SIR
7517-100442-0030 ONE OF OUR GREATEST SOLDIERS I THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS LAST MONDAY AND DEFINITELY RENOUNCED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A GROCER AND AS I WANDERED ROUND THE BOOKSTALL THINKING
7517-100442-0031 I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES
7517-100442-0032 SUCH AS HAVE GUIDED MEN ALONG THE PATH OF TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FROM WHAT HO SHE BUMPS TO ICH DIEN AND MORE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
7517-100442-0033 THAT AN INTERESTING ARTICLE MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM IT SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY ENOUGH I LEFT IT IN THE TRAIN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO MASTER IT I SHALL BE AT THE BOOKSTALL NEXT MONDAY
7517-100442-0034 AND I SHALL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER COPY THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU SHAN'T MISS IT BUT I AM WONDERING NOW WHAT THE BOOKSTALL CLERK WILL MAKE OF ME A MAN WHO KEEPS ON BUYING PROVERBS AND MAXIMS
