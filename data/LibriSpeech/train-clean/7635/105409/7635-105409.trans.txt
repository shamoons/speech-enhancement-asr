7635-105409-0000 MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
7635-105409-0001 THE VOICE CAME NEARER AND NEARER IN THE VAST IMMENSITY OF THESE LONELY CLIFFS WITH THE LOUD MURMUR OF THE SEA BELOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW NEAR OR HOW FAR NOR YET FROM WHICH DIRECTION CAME THAT CHEERFUL SINGER WHO SANG TO GOD TO SAVE HIS KING WHILST HE HIMSELF WAS IN SUCH DEADLY DANGER
7635-105409-0002 FELT THAT HER VERY LIFE WAS SLIPPING AWAY AS IF WHEN THAT VOICE DREW NEARER WHEN THAT SINGER BECAME ENTRAPPED SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CLICK OF DESGAS GUN CLOSE TO HER NO NO NO NO OH GOD IN HEAVEN THIS CANNOT BE
7635-105409-0003 LET ARMAND'S BLOOD THEN BE ON HER OWN HEAD LET HER BE BRANDED AS HIS MURDERER LET EVEN HE WHOM SHE LOVED DESPISE AND LOATHE HER FOR THIS BUT GOD OH GOD SAVE HIM AT ANY COST WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DARTED ROUND THE ROCK
7635-105409-0004 ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
7635-105409-0005 PERCY MY HUSBAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FLY ARMAND ARMAND WHY DON'T YOU FIRE
7635-105409-0006 SOMETHING WAS THROWN OVER HER FACE SHE COULD NOT BREATHE AND PERFORCE SHE WAS SILENT THE BOLD SINGER TOO HAD BECOME SILENT WARNED NO DOUBT OF HIS IMPENDING DANGER BY MARGUERITE'S FRANTIC SHRIEKS THE MEN HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FURTHER SILENCE ON THEIR PART
7635-105409-0007 THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
7635-105409-0008 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0009 THE DOOR WAS PARTIALLY OPEN ONE OF THE SOLDIERS PUSHED IT FURTHER BUT WITHIN ALL WAS DARKNESS THE CHARCOAL FIRE ONLY LIGHTING WITH A DIM RED LIGHT THE FURTHEST CORNER OF THE HUT THE SOLDIERS PAUSED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE DOOR LIKE MACHINES WAITING FOR FURTHER ORDERS
7635-105409-0010 WAS FOR THE MOMENT PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE SAW THE SOLDIERS STANDING THERE AT ATTENTION LIKE SENTRIES ON GUARD WHILST NOT A SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE HUT FILLED WITH STRANGE ANXIOUS FOREBODING HE TOO WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND PEERING INTO THE GLOOM HE ASKED QUICKLY
7635-105409-0011 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0012 THE MEN OBEDIENT AS MACHINES RUSHED DOWN THE ROCKY INCLINE TOWARDS THE BEACH SOME GOING OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT AS FAST AS THEIR FEET COULD CARRY THEM YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL PAY WITH YOUR LIVES FOR THIS BLUNDER CITOYEN SERGEANT SAID CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY TO THE SERGEANT WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE MEN
7635-105409-0013 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0015 YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN PROTESTED THE SERGEANT AND TO IMPLICITLY OBEY YOUR COMMANDS ON PAIN OF DEATH WE WAITED
7635-105409-0016 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
7635-105409-0017 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0018 EVIDENTLY ARMAND SAINT JUST AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS HAD MANAGED TO CREEP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CLIFFS WHILST THE MEN LIKE TRUE SOLDIERS OF THE WELL DRILLED REPUBLICAN ARMY HAD WITH BLIND OBEDIENCE AND IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES IMPLICITLY OBEYED CHAUVELIN'S ORDERS
7635-105409-0019 TO WAIT FOR THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS THE IMPORTANT CAPTURE THEY HAD NO DOUBT REACHED ONE OF THE CREEKS WHICH JUT FAR OUT TO SEA ON THIS COAST AT INTERVALS BEHIND THIS THE BOAT OF THE DAY DREAM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM
7635-105409-0020 IT NEEDED ALL CHAUVELIN'S NERVE AND PRESENCE OF MIND NOT TO GIVE WAY TO A USELESS AND UNDIGNIFIED ACCESS OF RAGE
7635-105409-0021 HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO REACH THE HUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ONE OF THE THIRTY SOLDIERS WHO GUARDED THE SPOT WAS MORE THAN CHAUVELIN COULD CONCEIVE THAT HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE THIRTY MEN HAD ARRIVED ON THE CLIFF WAS OF COURSE FAIRLY CLEAR
7635-105409-0022 THERE WERE NO FAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS ABOUT
7635-105409-0023 BY THAT TIME THE FOUR FUGITIVES MUST HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND GOT INTO THE BOAT AND THE NEAREST CREEK WAS MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HUT WHERE HAD THAT DARING SINGER GOT TO UNLESS SATAN HIMSELF HAD LENT HIM WINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE COVERED THAT MILE ON A ROCKY CLIFF IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
7635-105409-0024 ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
7635-105409-0025 WE WERE TOO LATE CITOYEN THE SOLDIER SAID WE REACHED THE BEACH JUST BEFORE THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY THAT BANK OF CLOUDS THE BOAT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BEHIND THAT FIRST CREEK A MILE OFF BUT SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE GOT TO THE BEACH AND WAS ALREADY SOME WAY OUT TO SEA
7635-105409-0026 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
7635-105409-0027 WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0029 IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
7635-105409-0030 IT IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE CITOYEN A FEARFUL SCRAWL I ORDERED YOU TO READ IT REPEATED CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY THE SERGEANT BY THE LIGHT OF HIS LANTERN BEGAN DECIPHERING THE FEW HASTILY SCRAWLED WORDS
7635-105409-0031 I CANNOT QUITE REACH YOU WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIVES AND ENDANGERING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESCUE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS WAIT TWO MINUTES THEN CREEP OUT OF THE HUT ONE BY ONE TURN TO YOUR LEFT SHARPLY AND CREEP CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE CLIFF
7635-105409-0032 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0033 BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
7635-105409-0034 THAT PHRASE MIGHT YET MEAN VICTORY FOR HIM WHICH OF YOU KNOWS THIS COAST WELL HE SHOUTED TO HIS MEN WHO NOW ONE BY ONE ALL RETURNED FROM THEIR FRUITLESS RUN AND WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ONCE MORE ROUND THE HUT
7635-105409-0035 THERE IS CITOYEN I KNOW IT WELL THE ENGLISHMAN IS HOPING TO REACH THAT CREEK
7635-105409-0036 AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
7635-105409-0037 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
7635-105409-0038 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0039 THE SOLDIERS WERE HOLDING MARGUERITE PINIONED TO THE GROUND THOUGH SHE POOR SOUL WAS NOT MAKING THE FAINTEST STRUGGLE
7635-105409-0040 HER EYES CIRCLED BY DEEP PURPLE LINES THAT TOLD OF LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HER HAIR MATTED AND DAMP ROUND HER FOREHEAD HER LIPS PARTED IN A SHARP CURVE THAT SPOKE OF PHYSICAL PAIN
7635-105409-0041 BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
7635-105409-0042 OBEDIENTLY THE SOLDIERS ROSE TO THEIR FEET YOU'D BETTER TRY AND FIND THAT FOOTPATH AGAIN FOR ME AND THAT BROKEN DOWN CART WE LEFT ON THE ROAD THEN SUDDENLY A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM AH BY THE BYE WHERE IS THE JEW
7635-105409-0043 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0045 WHILE A PITEOUS WAIL ESCAPED HIS BLOODLESS LIPS THE ROPE WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN WOUND ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS HAD EVIDENTLY GIVEN WAY FOR IT LAY IN A TANGLE ABOUT HIS BODY
7635-105409-0046 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0048 WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0050 B BUT YOUR HONOUR THERE IS NO BUT I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER
7635-105409-0051 YOUR HONOUR HE VENTURED IMPLORINGLY SINCE YOUR TERROR SEEMS TO HAVE PARALYZED YOUR TONGUE SAID CHAUVELIN SARCASTICALLY I MUST NEEDS REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
7635-105409-0052 IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
7635-105409-0053 BUT ADDED CHAUVELIN WITH SLOW EMPHASIS IF YOU DECEIVED ME IN YOUR PROMISE YOU WERE TO HAVE A SOUND BEATING ONE THAT WOULD TEACH YOU NOT TO TELL LIES I DID NOT YOUR HONOUR I SWEAR IT BY ABRAHAM
7635-105409-0054 AND BY ALL THE OTHER PATRIARCHS I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE STILL IN HADES I BELIEVE ACCORDING TO YOUR CREED AND CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH IN YOUR PRESENT TROUBLE NOW YOU DID NOT FULFIL YOUR SHARE OF THE BARGAIN BUT I AM READY TO FULFIL MINE HERE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0055 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0057 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105409-0058 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0060 AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
7635-105409-0061 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0063 WHILE SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON THE UNFORTUNATE JEW WAS RECEIVING ON HIS BROAD BACK THE BLOWS OF TWO STOUT LEATHER BELTS WIELDED BY THE STOLID ARMS OF TWO STURDY SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC THE HOWLS OF BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM WERE FIT TO MAKE THE DEAD RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES
7635-105409-0064 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0065 LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
7635-105409-0066 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WAS MAKING FEEBLE EFFORTS TO RAISE HERSELF HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE LOOKING AT THE MOONLIT SCENE ROUND HER WITH A SCARED AND TERRIFIED LOOK THEY RESTED WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR AND PITY ON THE JEW
7635-105409-0067 WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
7635-105409-0068 I MUCH REGRET FAIR LADY HE SAID IN HIS MOST SUAVE TONES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE FOR THE MOMENT BUT I GO AWAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT LEAVE YOU UNPROTECTED
7635-105409-0069 I HAVE NO DOUBT AT DAWN I WILL SEND AN ESCORT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN I FEEL SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM DEVOTED THOUGH PERHAPS A TRIFLE SLOW MARGUERITE ONLY HAD THE STRENGTH TO TURN HER HEAD AWAY HER HEART WAS BROKEN WITH CRUEL ANGUISH
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
