7859-102518-0000 THE ROMAN AND THE PERSIAN EMPIRES DRAINED OF MEN AND MONEY AND RAVAGED FROM END TO END BY EACH OTHER'S MARAUDING ARMIES SANK DOWN IN EXHAUSTION TO HEAL THEM OF THEIR DEADLY WOUNDS
7859-102518-0001 NEVER BEFORE HAD EITHER POWER DEALT ITS NEIGHBOUR SUCH FEARFUL BLOWS AS IN THIS LAST STRUGGLE IN PREVIOUS WARS THE CONTEST HAD BEEN WAGED AROUND BORDER FORTRESSES AND THE PRIZE HAD BEEN THE CONQUEST OF SOME SMALL SLICE OF MARCHLAND
7859-102518-0002 HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE
7859-102518-0003 THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
7859-102518-0004 AND DELIVERED AN ATTACK SO VEHEMENT THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO DESTROY THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF PERSIA AND TO SHEAR AWAY HALF THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
7859-102518-0005 THE POLITICS OF ARABIA HAD UP TO THIS TIME BEEN OF LITTLE MOMENT EITHER TO ROMAN OR PERSIAN EACH OF THEM HAD ALLIES AMONG THE ARAB TRIBES AND HAD SOMETIMES SENT AN EXPEDITION OR AN EMBASSY SOUTHWARD
7859-102518-0006 INTO THE LAND BEYOND THE SYRIAN DESERT BUT NEITHER OF THEM DREAMED THAT THE SCATTERED AND DISUNITED TRIBES OF ARABIA WOULD EVER COMBINE OR BECOME A SERIOUS DANGER
7859-102518-0007 EVENTS OF WORLD WIDE IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HISTORY THERE HAD ARISEN AMONG THE ARABS ONE OF THOSE WORLD COMPELLING MINDS THAT ARE DESTINED TO TURN ASIDE THE CURRENT OF EVENTS
7859-102518-0008 INTO NEW CHANNELS AND CHANGE THE FACE OF WHOLE CONTINENTS MAHOMET THAT STRANGEST OF MORAL ENIGMAS PROPHET AND SEER FANATIC AND IMPOSTOR WAS DEVELOPING HIS CAREER ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE PERSIAN WAR
7859-102518-0009 BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
7859-102518-0010 THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
7859-102518-0011 GOD WAS GOD AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET
7859-102518-0012 BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
7859-102518-0013 NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
7859-102518-0014 IS NOT A THING TO BE DESPISED
7859-102518-0015 NOR SCOFF WITH GIBBON AT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE TROOPS WHO WERE ROUTED BY THEM IF THE SOLDIERS OF QUEEN VICTORIA ARMED WITH MODERN RIFLES AND ARTILLERY FOUND THE FANATICAL ARAB A FORMIDABLE FOE LET US NOT BLAME THE SOLDIERS OF HERACLIUS WHO FACED THE SAME ENEMY
7859-102518-0016 IN THE EARLY ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EAST ROMANS AND THE SARACENS THE SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND MORE REGULAR ARMS OF THE ONE
7859-102518-0017 WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
7859-102518-0018 THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
7859-102518-0019 AND TO DO SO HAD NOT ONLY DRAINED THE TREASURY BUT IMPOSED SOME NEW AND UNWISE TAXES ON THE HARASSED PROVINCIALS AND DISBANDED MANY OF HIS VETERANS FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY
7859-102518-0020 SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION
7859-102518-0021 BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
7859-102518-0022 THEY SEEM TO HAVE CONSTITUTED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION AND BITTERLY RESENTED THE ENDEAVOURS OF HERACLIUS TO ENFORCE ORTHODOXY IN THE RECONQUERED PROVINCES THEIR DISCONTENT WAS SO BITTER
7859-102518-0023 THE DETAILS OF THE ARAB CONQUEST OF SYRIA HAVE NOT BEEN PRESERVED BY THE EAST ROMAN HISTORIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE HATED THE IDEA OF RECORDING THE DISASTERS OF CHRISTENDOM THE MOSLEMS ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NOT YET COMMENCED TO WRITE AND ERE HISTORIANS AROSE AMONG THEM
7859-102518-0024 THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
7859-102518-0025 GABATHA IN ITURAEA THOROUGHLY ROUSED BY THIS DISASTER HERACLIUS SET ALL THE LEGIONS OF THE EAST MARCHING AND SIXTY THOUSAND MEN CROSSED THE JORDAN AND ADVANCED TO RECOVER BOSTRA
7859-102518-0026 THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
7859-102518-0027 BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
7859-102518-0028 PARADISE IS BEFORE YOU THE DEVIL AND HELL FIRE BEHIND THE FANATICAL ORIENTALS THREW THEMSELVES ON REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND DROVE IT OFF THE FIELD ALL SYRIA EAST OF JORDAN WAS LOST IN THIS FATAL BATTLE DAMASCUS ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD
7859-102518-0029 MOST OF ITS POPULATION WERE MASSACRED
7859-102518-0030 AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
7859-102518-0031 TOOK THE TRUE CROSS FROM ITS SANCTUARY WHERE HE HAD REPLACED IT IN TRIUMPH FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND RETIRED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102518-0032 HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
7859-102518-0033 AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
7859-102518-0034 AND WHEN HE SAW THE RUDE ARAB STANDING BY THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE CRIED ALOUD NOW IS THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY DANIEL THE PROPHET TRULY IN THE HOLY PLACE
