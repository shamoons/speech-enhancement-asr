7859-102519-0000 WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
7859-102519-0001 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0002 LONG BEFORE HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF STATE CRAFT ERE HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR JUSTINIAN HAD PLUNGED INTO WAR WITH THE BULGARIANS HE ATTACKED THEM SUDDENLY INFLICTED SEVERAL DEFEATS ON THEIR KING
7859-102519-0003 AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
7859-102519-0004 BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
7859-102519-0005 AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
7859-102519-0006 JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
7859-102519-0007 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
7859-102519-0008 THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
7859-102519-0009 STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
7859-102519-0010 WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
7859-102519-0011 HE BEGAN TO EXECUTE OR IMPRISON HIS OFFICERS AND TO DECIMATE HIS BEATEN TROOPS TO BE EMPLOYED BY HIM IN HIGH COMMAND WAS ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS TO BE APPOINTED A GENERAL IN CHIEF DURING THE DICTATORSHIP OF ROBESPIERRE
7859-102519-0012 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0014 AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0017 THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
7859-102519-0018 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0020 HIS TROOPS GAINED SEVERAL VICTORIES OVER THE SARACENS
7859-102519-0021 AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
7859-102519-0022 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0023 WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
7859-102519-0024 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0025 THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
7859-102519-0026 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0029 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0032 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0035 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
7859-102519-0038 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0044 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
7859-102519-0047 IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
