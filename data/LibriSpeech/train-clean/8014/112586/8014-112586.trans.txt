8014-112586-0002 THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED WITH THE MAIN OBJECT OF SPREADING AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG OUR PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIVILISATION AND GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITION OF IRELAND FROM THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
8014-112586-0003 WHEN IT WAS WHOLLY GOVERNED BY NATIVE RULERS THE PUBLICATION COMES AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN THERE IS AN AWAKENING OF INTEREST IN THE IRISH LANGUAGE AND IN IRISH LORE OF EVERY KIND UNPARALLELED IN OUR HISTORY BUT THE BOOK HAS A FURTHER MISSION
8014-112586-0004 THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH AND MANY ANGLO IRISH PEOPLE WHO THINK MERELY FROM IGNORANCE THAT IRELAND WAS A BARBAROUS AND HALF SAVAGE COUNTRY BEFORE THE ENGLISH CAME AMONG THE PEOPLE AND CIVILISED THEM THIS BOOK SO FAR AS IT FINDS ITS WAY AMONG THE TWO CLASSES ABOVE MENTIONED WILL
8014-112586-0005 I FANCY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WILL LEARN FROM IT THAT THE OLD IRISH SO FAR FROM BEING BARBAROUS WERE A BRIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURED PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONS TRADES AND INDUSTRIES PERVADING THE WHOLE POPULATION
8014-112586-0006 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0007 AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
8014-112586-0008 THAT THEY HELPED MOST MATERIALLY TO SPREAD CHRISTIANITY AND TO REVIVE LEARNING ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND THAT TO IRISH MISSIONARIES AND SCHOLARS THE ANGLO SAXONS OF THE HEPTARCHY WERE INDEBTED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THEIR CHRISTIANITY
8014-112586-0009 AND FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ALL OVER ENGLAND BY THE RAVAGES OF THE DANES BUT THERE WERE AND ARE ENGLISHMEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY
8014-112586-0010 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT ENGLISH POET EDMUND SPENSER LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN IRELAND AND MADE HIMSELF WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS HISTORY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN PAST AGES
8014-112586-0011 OF WEALTH AND GOODNESSE FAR ABOVE THE REST
8014-112586-0012 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
