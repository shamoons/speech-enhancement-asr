8014-280382-0000 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0002 THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0005 IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0008 KING PORSENNA TO ROB OTHERS OF THE FREEDOM THAT YE CARE NOT TO HAVE FOR YOURSELVES
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
8014-280382-0011 AND AS THE ENEMY STAYED A WHILE FOR FEAR HORATIUS TURNED HIM TO THE RIVER AND SAID O FATHER TIBER I BESEECH THEE THIS DAY WITH ALL REVERENCE THAT THOU KINDLY RECEIVE THIS SOLDIER AND HIS ARMS AND AS HE SPAKE HE LEAPT WITH ALL HIS ARMS INTO THE RIVER
8014-280382-0012 AND SWAM ACROSS TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THOUGH MANY JAVELINS OF THE ENEMY FELL ABOUT HIM HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT HURT NOR DID SUCH VALOR FAIL TO RECEIVE DUE HONOR FROM THE CITY
