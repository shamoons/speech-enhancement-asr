8051-119902-0000 CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
8051-119902-0001 AT ANOTHER OATEN CAKE AND AT ANOTHER CORN PONE BREAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHATEVER CEREAL HAPPENED TO BE CONVENIENT EVEN SUCH UNBREADLIKE FOOD AS RICE IS TO SOME RACES WHAT BREAD IS TO US
8051-119902-0002 WHY THEN HAVE WE DEVELOPED OUR WHEAT BREAD HABIT PARTLY BECAUSE WHEAT BREAD HAS BEEN EASY TO GET AND WE HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE TASTE BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE WHEAT FLOUR GIVES THE LIGHTEST LOAF
8051-119902-0003 TO UNDERSTAND WHY MAKE A DOUGH WITH A LITTLE WHITE FLOUR AND WATER AND THEN GENTLY KNEAD IT IN COLD WATER THE CONSISTENCY CHANGES THE STARCH IS WASHED OUT AND A RUBBERY STICKY BALL IS LEFT
8051-119902-0004 THE GLUTEN WHICH IS THE PROTEIN OF THE WHEAT IT IS THIS GLUTEN IN THE FLOUR THAT STRETCHES WHEN BREAD RISES AND THEN STIFFENS WHEN IT IS BAKED MAKING A LIGHT POROUS LOAF
8051-119902-0005 WHEAT IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE CEREALS THAT HAS MUCH GLUTEN RYE HAS A LITTLE AND THE OTHERS PRACTICALLY NONE GLUTEN SEEMS TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE MAKING OF A LIGHT YEAST RAISED LOAF
8051-119902-0006 PRODUCTS RAISED WITH BAKING POWDER FOR WHICH OUR STANDARD OF LIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT QUICK BREADS LIKE BISCUITS AND MUFFINS AND CAKES DO NOT REQUIRE THE GLUTEN AND CAN EASILY BE MADE FROM SUBSTITUTE CEREALS
8051-119902-0007 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PRODUCE A WHEATLESS LOAF WHICH IS LIGHT PALATABLE AND SUFFICIENTLY DURABLE TO STAND TRANSPORTATION THE DURABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION CRUMBLY CORN BREAD CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED BY BAKERS NOR SERVED TO ARMIES
8051-119902-0008 THE BAKERS REGULATIONS VICTORY BREAD THE BAKERS HAVE CO OPERATED LOYALLY PROBABLY NO OTHER FOOD INDUSTRY HAS BEEN MORE VITALLY AFFECTED BY THE WAR
8051-119902-0009 ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
8051-119902-0010 AND MANY HOTELS CLUBS AND INSTITUTIONS ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THE BREAD IN THE UNITED STATES IS MADE IN BAKERIES AND THREE FIFTHS IN THE HOME THE BAKERIES HAVE USED THIRTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS OF FLOUR EACH YEAR
8051-119902-0011 OR IF THEY ARE PASTRY AND CRACKER BAKERS SEVENTY PER CENT THEY MUST MAKE NO BREAD WHOLLY OF WHEAT FLOUR SOME SUBSTITUTE MUST BE MIXED WITH THE WHEAT WHEN THE REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
8051-119902-0012 TWENTY PER CENT WAS REQUIRED AND LATER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN PIES AND CAKES THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE THIRD SUBSTITUTE THE AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND FAT USED ARE LIMITED
8051-119902-0013 EVEN THE SIZES OF THE LOAVES ARE FIXED SO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF MAKING AND HANDLING ALL SORTS OF FANCY SHAPES AND SIZES MAY BE AVOIDED BREAD MUST NOT BE SOLD TO THE RETAILER AT UNREASONABLE PRICES
8051-119902-0014 VICTORY BREAD IS BREAD MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS THE NAME VICTORY WAS CHOSEN AS REPRESENTING THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE CONSERVATION OF WHEAT
8051-119902-0015 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0016 HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE OR SERVE BREAD CONTAINING AT LEAST AS MUCH OF THE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES AS VICTORY BREAD THEY MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO OUNCES OF BREAD AND OTHER WHEAT PRODUCTS TO A GUEST AT A MEAL
8051-119902-0017 THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT ONLY THROUGH INTELLIGENT EFFORT CAN THEY SERVE YEAST BREAD
8051-119902-0018 UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
8051-119902-0019 AND YOU NEED NO BREAD AT ALL AT SOME MEALS AN EXTRA POTATO OR A SERVING OF RICE CAN BE EATEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TWO SLICES OF BREAD AND THE BODY WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY DO NOT BE THE SLAVE OF OLD FOOD HABITS
8051-119902-0020 WHEN ALL EUROPE IS EATING TO KEEP ALIVE FASTIDIOUSNESS AND FOOD NOTIONS MUST PLAY NO PART IN THE DIETARY
8051-119902-0021 HUNDREDS IN CROWDED CITY QUARTERS HAVE NO FACILITIES OF THEIR OWN FOR BAKING WOMEN DOING THEIR SHARE IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS CANNOT GET UP EARLIER TO MAKE CORN BREAD FOR BREAKFAST VICTORY BREAD MUST BE SAVED FOR THEM
8051-119902-0022 FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHICH MUST USE WHEAT
8051-119902-0023 THIS INCLUDES WHEAT IN THE FORM OF BREAD PASTRY MACARONI CRACKERS NOODLES AND BREAKFAST FOODS
8051-119902-0024 THE INTERESTS AND DESIRES OF EACH OF US IN THIS WAR CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO SERVICE IN NO MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAN BY CONFORMING OUR FOOD HABITS TO THE NEEDS OF THE HOUR FLOUR AND BREAD IN THE ALLIED COUNTRIES
8051-119902-0025 IN ENGLAND THERE ARE LOCAL REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF MASHED POTATO IN BREAD THEIR BREAD MUST BE TWELVE HOURS OLD BEFORE IT IS SOLD SO THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO EAT TOO MUCH THE RESULT IS SELDOM PALATABLE
8051-119902-0026 IN FRANCE NO FLOUR AT ALL MAY BE USED TO MAKE THE DELECTABLE PASTRIES AND CAKES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THEIR GUESTS IN ITALY
8051-119902-0027 MUST CONTAIN FORTY THREE PER CENT SUBSTITUTE AND IN SOME PLACES MAY NOT BE MANUFACTURED AT ALL BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAVE SUBSIDIZED BREAD THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET A PRICE BELOW COST
8051-119902-0028 AND ITSELF MAKES UP THE DIFFERENCE TO THE BAKER ENGLAND HAS APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSE BREAD RATIONS ARE IN FORCE IN BOTH FRANCE AND ITALY
8051-119902-0029 FRANCE HAS RECENTLY PUT HER WHOLE PEOPLE ON A RIGOROUS RATION WHICH LIMITS THEM TO TWO THIRDS OF THE AMOUNT OF BREAD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REMEMBER THAT BREAD IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE FRENCH DIET THAN OF OURS
8051-119902-0030 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8051-119902-0031 THE VOLUNTARY RATION ALLOWS ONE HALF POUND OF BREAD A DAY FOR SEDENTARY AND UNOCCUPIED WOMEN AND LARGER ALLOWANCES UP TO A LITTLE OVER A POUND FOR MEN DOING HEAVY LABOR
8051-119902-0032 WASTE OF ANY KIND IS VERY HEAVILY PUNISHED ONE WOMAN WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THROWING AWAY STALE BREAD WHY NOT SEND CORN ABROAD
8051-119902-0033 THE ANSWERS ARE MANY IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ARE SENDING CORN OVER OUR EXPORTS OF CORN DURING MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INCREASED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT AND OF CORN MEAL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PER CENT
8051-119902-0034 OVER THE PRE WAR AVERAGE THIS THEY ARE USING AS WE ARE USING IT IN OUR VICTORY BREAD BUT THEY MUST HAVE ENOUGH WHEAT TO MAKE A DURABLE LOAF OF BREAD AT THE BAKESHOPS WHERE FOR GENERATIONS ALL THE BAKING HAS BEEN DONE
8051-119902-0035 AND THE EXTRA UNACCUSTOMED LABOR OF BREAD MAKING CANNOT BE ADDED TO HER BURDENS WHY WE IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT HAVE BREAD CARDS SOME PEOPLE DISTURBED EITHER SELFISHLY OR PATRIOTICALLY
8051-119902-0036 BY THE FAILURE OF A NEIGHBOR TO CONSERVE WHEAT HAVE ASKED WHY THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TRUSTS TO VOLUNTARY METHODS WHY IT DOES NOT RATION THE COUNTRY RATIONING MAY COME YET BUT ANY SUCH SYSTEM BRISTLES WITH DIFFICULTIES
8051-119902-0037 THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
8051-119902-0038 BUT ON THOSE WITH LITTLE TO SPEND WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WHOLE FOOD HABITS THE SUCCESS THAT IS MEETING OUR METHOD OF VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF CONSUMPTION
