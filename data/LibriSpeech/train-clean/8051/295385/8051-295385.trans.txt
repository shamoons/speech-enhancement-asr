8051-295385-0000 AND HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE CHAPTER ONE HITHERTO MOST VENERABLE AND COURTEOUS READER HAVE I SHOWN THEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VALOROUS STUYVESANT UNDER THE MILD MOONSHINE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0001 OR RATHER THE GRIM TRANQUILLITY OF AWFUL EXPECTATION BUT NOW THE WAR DRUM RUMBLES FROM AFAR THE BRAZEN TRUMPET BRAYS ITS THRILLING NOTE
8051-295385-0002 AND THE RUDE CLASH OF HOSTILE ARMS SPEAKS FEARFUL PROPHECIES OF COMING TROUBLES THE GALLANT WARRIOR STARTS FROM SOFT REPOSE FROM GOLDEN VISIONS AND VOLUPTUOUS EASE WHERE IN THE DULCET PIPING TIME OF PEACE
8051-295385-0003 NOR THROUGH THE LIVELONG LAZY SUMMER'S DAY CHANTS FORTH HIS LOVE SICK SOUL IN MADRIGALS TO MANHOOD ROUSED HE SPURNS THE AMOROUS FLUTE DOFFS FROM HIS BRAWNY BACK THE ROBE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0004 AND CLOTHES HIS PAMPERED LIMBS IN PANOPLY OF STEEL O'ER HIS DARK BROW WHERE LATE THE MYRTLE WAVED WHERE WANTON ROSES BREATHED ENERVATE LOVE HE REARS THE BEAMING CASQUE AND NODDING PLUME GRASPS THE BRIGHT SHIELD
8051-295385-0005 EXISTED IN THE CITY OF NEW AMSTERDAM THIS IS BUT A LOFTY AND GIGANTIC MODE IN WHICH WE HEROIC WRITERS ALWAYS TALK OF WAR THEREBY TO GIVE IT A NOBLE AND IMPOSING ASPECT
8051-295385-0006 EQUIPPING OUR WARRIORS WITH BUCKLERS HELMS AND LANCES AND SUCH LIKE OUTLANDISH AND OBSOLETE WEAPONS THE LIKE OF WHICH PERCHANCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN THE SAME MANNER THAT A CUNNING STATUARY ARRAYS A MODERN GENERAL OR AN ADMIRAL
8051-295385-0007 IN THE ACCOUTREMENTS OF A CAESAR OR AN ALEXANDER THE SIMPLE TRUTH THEN OF ALL THIS ORATORICAL FLOURISH IS THIS THAT THE VALIANT PETER STUYVESANT ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUND IT NECESSARY
8051-295385-0008 AND PREPARE HIMSELF TO UNDERGO THOSE HARDY TOILS OF WAR IN WHICH HIS MIGHTY SOUL SO MUCH DELIGHTED METHINKS I AT THIS MOMENT BEHOLD HIM IN MY IMAGINATION OR RATHER I BEHOLD HIS GOODLY PORTRAIT
8051-295385-0009 WHICH STILL HANGS IN THE FAMILY MANSION OF THE STUYVESANTS ARRAYED IN ALL THE TERRORS OF A TRUE DUTCH GENERAL HIS REGIMENTAL COAT OF GERMAN BLUE GORGEOUSLY DECORATED WITH A GOODLY SHOW OF LARGE BRASS BUTTONS
8051-295385-0010 REACHING FROM HIS WAISTBAND TO HIS CHIN THE VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS TURNED UP AT THE CORNERS AND SEPARATING GALLANTLY BEHIND SO AS TO DISPLAY THE SEAT OF A SUMPTUOUS PAIR OF BRIMSTONE COLORED TRUNK BREECHES
8051-295385-0011 A GRACEFUL STYLE STILL PREVALENT AMONG THE WARRIORS OF OUR DAY AND WHICH IS IN CONFORMITY TO THE CUSTOM OF ANCIENT HEROES WHO SCORNED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN REAR
8051-295385-0012 STUCK WITH A GALLANT AND FIERY AIR OVER HIS LEFT EYE SUCH WAS THE CHIVALRIC PORT OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG AND WHEN HE MADE A SUDDEN HALT PLANTED HIMSELF FIRMLY ON HIS SOLID SUPPORTER
8051-295385-0013 WITH HIS WOODEN LEG INLAID WITH SILVER A LITTLE IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING A GOLD HEADED CANE HIS LEFT RESTING UPON THE PUMMEL OF HIS SWORD HIS HEAD DRESSING SPIRITEDLY TO THE RIGHT
8051-295385-0014 WITH A MOST APPALLING AND HARD FAVORED FROWN UPON HIS BROW HE PRESENTED ALTOGETHER ONE OF THE MOST COMMANDING BITTER LOOKING AND SOLDIER LIKE FIGURES THAT EVER STRUTTED UPON CANVAS
8051-295385-0015 PROCEED WE NOW TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE OF THIS WARLIKE PREPARATION IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE FOUNDING OF FORT CASIMIR AND OF THE MERCILESS WARFARE WAGED BY ITS COMMANDER
8051-295385-0016 UPON CABBAGES SUNFLOWERS AND PUMPKINS FOR WANT OF BETTER OCCASION TO FLESH HIS SWORD NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HIGHER UP THE DELAWARE AT HIS STRONGHOLD OF TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0017 WHO STYLED HIMSELF GOVERNOR OF NEW SWEDEN IF HISTORY BELIE NOT THIS REDOUBTABLE SWEDE HE WAS A RIVAL WORTHY OF THE WINDY AND INFLATED COMMANDER OF FORT CASIMIR FOR MASTER DAVID PIETERZEN DE VRIE IN HIS EXCELLENT BOOK OF VOYAGES
8051-295385-0018 DESCRIBES HIM AS WEIGHING UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS A HUGE FEEDER AND BOUSER IN PROPORTION TAKING THREE POTATIONS POTTLE DEEP AT EVERY MEAL HE HAD A GARRISON AFTER HIS OWN HEART AT TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0019 GUZZLING DEEP DRINKING SWASHBUCKLERS WHO MADE THE WILD WOODS RING WITH THEIR CAROUSALS NO SOONER DID THIS ROBUSTIOUS COMMANDER HEAR OF THE ERECTION OF FORT CASIMIR THAN HE SENT A MESSAGE TO VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0020 WARNING HIM OFF THE LAND AS BEING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HIS JURISDICTION TO THIS GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH REPLIED THAT THE LAND BELONGED TO THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES HAVING BEEN REGULARLY PURCHASED OF THE NATIVES AS DISCOVERERS
8051-295385-0021 FROM THE MANHATTOES AS WITNESS THE BREECHES OF THEIR LAND MEASURER TEN BROECK TO THIS THE GOVERNOR REJOINED THAT THE LAND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLD BY THE INDIANS TO THE SWEDES AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS UNDER THE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT
8051-295385-0022 OF HER SWEDISH MAJESTY CHRISTINA AND WOE BE TO ANY MORTAL THAT WORE A BREECHES WHO SHOULD DARE TO MEDDLE EVEN WITH THE HEM OF HER SACRED GARMENT
8051-295385-0023 I FORBEAR TO DILATE UPON THE WAR OF WORDS WHICH WAS KEPT UP FOR SOME TIME BY THESE WINDY COMMANDERS VAN POFFENBURGH HOWEVER HAD SERVED UNDER WILLIAM THE TESTY AND WAS A VETERAN IN THIS KIND OF WARFARE
8051-295385-0024 GOVERNOR PRINTZ FINDING HE WAS NOT TO BE DISLODGED BY THESE LONG SHOTS NOW DETERMINED UPON COMING TO CLOSER QUARTERS ACCORDINGLY HE DESCENDED THE RIVER IN GREAT FORCE AND FUME AND ERECTED A RIVAL FORTRESS
8051-295385-0025 JUST ONE SWEDISH MILE BELOW FORT CASIMIR TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAME OF HELSENBURG AND NOW COMMENCED A TREMENDOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN THESE TWO DOUGHTY COMMANDERS STRIVING TO OUTSTRUT AND OUTSWELL EACH OTHER
8051-295385-0026 LIKE A COUPLE OF BELLIGERENT TURKEY COCKS THERE WAS A CONTEST WHO SHOULD RUN UP THE TALLEST FLAG STAFF AND DISPLAY THE BROADEST FLAG ALL DAY LONG THERE WAS A FURIOUS ROLLING OF DRUMS AND TWANGING OF TRUMPETS IN EITHER FORTRESS
8051-295385-0027 AND WHICHEVER HAD THE WIND IN ITS FAVOR WOULD KEEP UP A CONTINUAL FIRING OF CANNON TO TAUNT ITS ANTAGONIST WITH THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON ALL THESE POINTS OF WINDY WARFARE THE ANTAGONISTS WERE WELL MATCHED
8051-295385-0028 BUT SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE SWEDISH FORTRESS BEING LOWER DOWN THE RIVER ALL THE DUTCH VESSELS BOUND TO FORT CASIMIR WITH SUPPLIES HAD TO PASS IT
8051-295385-0029 GOVERNOR PRINTZ AT ONCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND COMPELLED THEM TO LOWER THEIR FLAGS AS THEY PASSED UNDER THE GUNS OF HIS BATTERY THIS WAS A DEADLY WOUND TO THE DUTCH PRIDE OF GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0030 AND SORELY WOULD HE SWELL WHEN FROM THE RAMPARTS OF FORT CASIMIR HE BEHELD THE FLAG OF THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES STRUCK TO THE RIVAL FORTRESS TO HEIGHTEN HIS VEXATION GOVERNOR PRINTZ WHO AS HAS BEEN SHOWN WAS A HUGE TRENCHERMAN
8051-295385-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE PAID TO THE DUTCH SKIPPERS THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR COMMODITIES BUT WHAT CONSOLATION WAS THIS TO JACOBUS VAN POFFENBURGH AND HIS GARRISON WHO THUS FOUND THEIR FAVORITE SUPPLIES CUT OFF
8051-295385-0032 AND DIVERTED INTO THE LARDERS OF THE HOSTILE CAMPS FOR SOME TIME THIS WAR OF THE CUPBOARD WAS CARRIED ON TO THE GREAT FESTIVITY AND JOLLIFICATION OF THE SWEDES WHILE THE WARRIORS OF FORT CASIMIR FOUND THEIR HEARTS OR RATHER THEIR STOMACHS
8051-295385-0033 DAILY FAILING THEM AT LENGTH THE SUMMER HEATS AND SUMMER SHOWERS SET IN AND NOW LO AND BEHOLD A GREAT MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE NEDERLANDS
8051-295385-0034 FOR IT CAME TO PASS THAT A GREAT CLOUD OF MOSQUITOS AROSE OUT OF THE MARSHY BORDERS OF THE RIVER AND SETTLED UPON THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG BEING DOUBTLESS ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE FRESH BLOOD OF THE SWEDISH GORMANDISERS
8051-295385-0035 NAY IT IS SAID THAT THE BODY OF JAN PRINTZ ALONE
8051-295385-0036 WAS SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE MOSQUITO FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME THE GARRISON ENDEAVORED TO HOLD OUT BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN THE MOSQUITOS PENETRATED INTO EVERY CHINK AND CREVICE AND GAVE THEM NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT
8051-295385-0037 SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES
8051-295385-0038 TO THE MIRACULOUS INTERVENTION OF SAINT NICHOLAS AS TO THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG IT FELL TO RUIN
