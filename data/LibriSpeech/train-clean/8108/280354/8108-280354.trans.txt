8108-280354-0000 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0002 WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY AND WHO RETURNED HIS LOVE BUT AT THEIR MARRIAGE THE OMENS WERE NOT FAVORABLE HYMEN THE MARRIAGE GOD CAME TO IT WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE AND THE WEDDING TORCHES SMOKED
8108-280354-0003 AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
8108-280354-0004 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0005 INTO MOST PASSIONATE GRIEF AT HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LOST HER FOR EVER BUT PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT CEASING TO THE GODS ABOVE TO RESTORE HER TO HIM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
8108-280354-0006 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0007 IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
8108-280354-0008 THE THREE HEADED DOG THAT GUARDS THE THRESHOLD OF PLUTO UNDAUNTED BY THE TERRORS OF THE PLACE ORPHEUS PASSED THROUGH THIS GATE AND DOWN A DARK AND DISMAL ROAD TO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD
8108-280354-0009 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS
8108-280354-0010 GREAT LORDS OF THE WORLD BELOW THE EARTH TO WHICH ALL WE MORTALS MUST ONE DAY COME GRANT ME TO TELL A SIMPLE TALE
8108-280354-0011 THE LIFELESS GHOSTS CAME FLOCKING AND AS THEY HEARD THEY WEPT TANTALUS FORGOT HIS HUNGER AND THIRST
8108-280354-0012 SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
8108-280354-0013 AND SHE CAME YET HALTING FROM HER RECENT WOUND TAKE HER SAYS PLUTO AND LEAD HER BACK TO THE LIGHT
8108-280354-0014 NOR MUST YOU ONCE TURN ROUND TO LOOK UPON HER
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0016 AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
8108-280354-0017 HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
8108-280354-0018 HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
8108-280354-0019 THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
8108-280354-0020 FINDING HIS ONLY CONSOLATION IN THE MUSIC OF HIS LYRE FOR HE SHUNNED ALL MEN AND WOMEN
8108-280354-0021 ONE DAY HE SAT DOWN TO REST ON A GRASSY HILL IN THE SUNSHINE AND PLAYED AND SANG TO BEGUILE HIS SORROW AS HE PLAYED THE COOLNESS OF SHADY BRANCHES SEEMED ALL ABOUT HIM AND LOOKING UP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A WOOD
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0023 YES AND THE BEASTS AND THE BIRDS OF THE FIELD CAME TOO AND ORPHEUS SAT IN THEIR MIDST AND SANG AND PLAYED THE TUNES OF SORROW SUDDENLY A GREAT NOISE WAS HEARD OF LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING AND MERRY MAKING
8108-280354-0024 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0025 THE WRETCHED SINGER WHO MOCKS AT WOMEN AND WILL HAVE NO BRIDE BUT THE DEAD COME LET US KILL HIM AND SHOW THAT NO MAN SHALL DESPISE US UNPUNISHED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BEGAN TO THROW WANDS AND STONES AT HIM
8108-280354-0026 AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE GROUND THEN THE WOMEN RAISED A WILD SHOUT AND MADE SUCH A CLAMOR WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS THAT THE SOFT TONES OF THE HARP WERE DROWNED BY THE NOISE NOW AT LAST THE SHOTS TOOK EFFECT
8108-280354-0027 AND IN THEIR FURY THE WOMEN FELL UPON HIM DEALING BLOW ON BLOW ORPHEUS FELL LIFELESS TO THE GROUND BUT HE WAS NOT TO DIE UNWEPT THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FOREST MOURNED FOR HIM EVEN THE STONY ROCKS WEPT
8108-280354-0028 THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
8108-280354-0029 AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
8108-280354-0030 IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
8108-280354-0031 AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
