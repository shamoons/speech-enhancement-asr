83-9960-0000 THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
83-9960-0001 THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
83-9960-0002 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0003 AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
83-9960-0004 THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
83-9960-0005 THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
83-9960-0006 THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
83-9960-0007 MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
83-9960-0008 AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
83-9960-0009 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0010 I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
83-9960-0011 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0013 WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
83-9960-0014 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0016 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
83-9960-0017 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
83-9960-0019 SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
83-9960-0020 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0022 IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
83-9960-0023 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0024 WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
83-9960-0025 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0027 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
83-9960-0028 THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
83-9960-0029 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0031 WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
83-9960-0032 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0033 THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
83-9960-0034 TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
83-9960-0035 IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
83-9960-0036 HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
83-9960-0037 THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
83-9960-0038 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0039 THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
83-9960-0040 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
83-9960-0041 THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
83-9960-0042 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0043 SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
83-9960-0044 READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
83-9960-0045 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0046 OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0048 MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
83-9960-0049 THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
83-9960-0050 SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
83-9960-0051 SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
83-9960-0052 THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
83-9960-0053 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
83-9960-0055 THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
83-9960-0056 WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
