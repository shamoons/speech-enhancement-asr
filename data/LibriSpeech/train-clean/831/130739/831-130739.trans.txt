831-130739-0000 THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP

831-130739-0005 HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
831-130739-0006 UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
831-130739-0007 NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
831-130739-0008 HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
831-130739-0009 WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
831-130739-0010 HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
831-130739-0011 MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
831-130739-0012 SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
831-130739-0013 HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
831-130739-0014 ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
831-130739-0015 BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
831-130739-0016 IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
831-130739-0017 THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
831-130739-0018 LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
831-130739-0019 AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
831-130739-0020 ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
831-130739-0021 TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
831-130739-0022 AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
831-130739-0023 THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
831-130739-0024 FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
831-130739-0025 HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
831-130739-0026 EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
831-130739-0027 ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
831-130739-0028 WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
831-130739-0029 CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
831-130739-0030 OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
831-130739-0031 FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
831-130739-0032 TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
831-130739-0033 UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
831-130739-0034 RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
831-130739-0035 A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
831-130739-0036 THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
831-130739-0037 TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
831-130739-0038 BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
831-130739-0039 AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
831-130739-0040 A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
831-130739-0041 THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
831-130739-0042 THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
831-130739-0043 HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE

831-130739-0046 HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
831-130739-0047 OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
831-130739-0048 ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
831-130739-0049 THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH

831-130739-0053 YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
831-130739-0054 I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
831-130739-0055 WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND

831-130739-0062 A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
