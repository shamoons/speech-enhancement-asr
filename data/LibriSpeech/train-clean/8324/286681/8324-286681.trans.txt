8324-286681-0000 TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
8324-286681-0001 THE LARGER PEOPLE HAD BEEN SORRY TO HAVE THEM GO AND SOME OF THEM FELT THAT WITHOUT THE EELS AWAKE AND STIRRING THE POND WAS HARDLY A SAFE PLACE AT NIGHT I THINK IT IS A GOOD DEAL SAFER REMARKED A MINNOW WHO USUALLY SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
8324-286681-0002 OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM SAID A STICKLEBACK WHY REPLIED THE MINNOW IF I HAD GONE TO THE EELS AND ASKED THEM THAT
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0004 A WISE OLD CRAYFISH CAME ALONG WALKING SIDEWISE
8324-286681-0005 THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
8324-286681-0006 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
8324-286681-0007 WHEN THERE WAS NEED OF IT HE COULD TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS AND INDEED THAT VERY EVENING HE DID SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE EELS THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS TEACHING SOME YOUNG CRAYFISHES HIS PUPILS
8324-286681-0008 THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
8324-286681-0009 BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
8324-286681-0010 THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
8324-286681-0011 EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
8324-286681-0012 AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0013 THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND NOW WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIDE AWAKE HE FELT EXCEEDINGLY DULL AND STUPID WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS EIGHT LEGS STUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
8324-286681-0014 AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
8324-286681-0015 ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0016 ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0018 STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
8324-286681-0019 SAID ONE LITTLE CRAYFISH WHO THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE SAUCY WE'LL LOOK
8324-286681-0020 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0021 JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
8324-286681-0022 AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
8324-286681-0023 SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
8324-286681-0024 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
