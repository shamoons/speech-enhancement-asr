8419-293473-0000 THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
8419-293473-0001 PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR RELATIVES BUT THEN IF ONE IS A WALKING STICK YOU KNOW ONE DOES NOT CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ONE'S FAMILY THESE WALKING STICKS HAD GROWN UP THE BEST WAY THEY COULD WITH NO FATHER OR MOTHER TO CARE FOR THEM
8419-293473-0002 THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
8419-293473-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
8419-293473-0004 THEY SAID IT WAS NOT GENTEEL TO HURRY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY THE TREE FROG WAS UNDER THE TREE WHEN THE LARGE BROWN WALKING STICK DECIDED TO LAY SOME EGGS HE SAW HER DROPPING THEM CARELESSLY AROUND ON THE GROUND AND ASKED
8419-293473-0005 DO YOU NEVER FIX A PLACE FOR YOUR EGGS A PLACE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK WAVING HER LONG AND SLENDER FEELERS TO AND FRO A PLACE OH NO I THINK THEY WILL HATCH WHERE THEY ARE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND A PLACE
8419-293473-0006 SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
8419-293473-0007 SHE HAD ONCE TOLD HER BROTHER THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK THAT SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IF SHE COULD NOT BE GENTEEL SHE THOUGHT THE MEADOW PEOPLE VERY COMMON THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK LOOKED MUCH LIKE HIS SISTER HE HAD THE SAME LONG SLENDER BODY
8419-293473-0008 THE SAME LONG FEELERS AND THE SAME SORT OF LONG SLENDER LEGS IF YOU HAD PASSED THEM IN A HAY FIELD YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE THOUGHT EACH A STEM OF HAY UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO SEE THEM MOVE THE OTHER WALKING STICK THEIR FRIEND WAS YOUNGER AND GREEN
8419-293473-0009 HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
8419-293473-0010 THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN
8419-293473-0011 OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
8419-293473-0012 AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
8419-293473-0013 THEIR FEELERS WERE HELD QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY DID NOT MOVE THEIR FEET AT ALL ONLY SWAYED THEIR BODIES GRACEFULLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW THEY WERE ON THE GROUND HUNTING THROUGH THE FLAT PILES OF CUT GRASS FOR SOME FRESH AND JUICY BITS TO EAT
8419-293473-0014 THE ANTS WERE SCRAMBLING AROUND AS BUSY AS EVER AND LIFE WENT ON QUITE AS THOUGH NEITHER MEN NOR HORSES HAD EVER ENTERED THE MEADOW SEE CRIED A SPIDER WHO WAS BUSILY LOOKING AFTER HER WEB THERE COMES A HORSE DRAWING SOMETHING AND THE FARMER SITTING ON IT AND DRIVING
8419-293473-0015 WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE
8419-293473-0016 THEN THERE WAS A GREAT SCRAMBLING AND THE CRICKETS FROLICKED WITH THEM THE YOUNG WALKING STICK THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE GREAT FUN AND ALMOST WISHED HERSELF SOME OTHER KIND OF INSECT SO THAT SHE COULD TUMBLE AROUND IN THE SAME WAY SHE DID NOT QUITE WISH IT YOU UNDERSTAND
8419-293473-0017 AND WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IF SHE HAD TURNED BROWN AH SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK WHAT SCRAMBLING HOW VERY COMMON YES INDEED SAID HIS SISTER WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND GRACEFULLY
8419-293473-0018 PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
8419-293473-0019 IT IS JUST TO BE GENTEEL TO ACT AS YOU SEE US ACT AND TO JUST HERE THE HAY TEDDER PASSED OVER THEM AND EVERY ONE OF THE WALKING STICKS WAS SENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND LANDED ON HIS BACK
8419-293473-0020 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
