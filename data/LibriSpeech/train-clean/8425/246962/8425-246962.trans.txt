8425-246962-0000 BEFORE THE MORNING LEOPOLD LAY WOUND IN THE NET OF A LOW FEVER ALMOST AS ILL AS EVER BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR LESS TROUBLED AND THAT EVEN HIS MOST RESTLESS DREAMS
8425-246962-0001 TO THE FINAL EXECUTION OF THE LAW SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FOLLOW IT ALL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE COLD DEW ALWAYS APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD
8425-246962-0002 TALKING FACE TO FACE WITH JESUS
8425-246962-0003 WAS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTY FOR HELEN HERSELF SHE WAS PREY TO A HOST OF CHANGEFUL EMOTIONS AT ONE TIME SHE ACCUSED HERSELF BITTERLY OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE RETURN OF HIS ILLNESS
8425-246962-0004 THE NEXT A GUSH OF GLADNESS WOULD SWELL HER HEART AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE HAD HIM AT LEAST SAFER FOR A WHILE AND THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SO ESCAPE THE WHOLE CROWD OF HORRIBLE POSSIBILITIES
8425-246962-0005 FOR GEORGE'S MANIPULATION OF THE MAGISTRATE COULD BUT DELAY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH EVEN SHOULD NO DISCOVERY BE MADE LEOPOLD MUST AT LENGTH SUSPECT A TRICK AND THAT WOULD AT ONCE DRIVE HIM TO FRESH ACTION
8425-246962-0006 BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
8425-246962-0007 THAT SHE HAD TAKEN THE EVIL PART AGAINST THE ONE SHE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS A SATAN TO HIM HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK STOOD ALMOST BODILY IN THE WAY TO TURN HIM FROM THE PATH OF PEACE
8425-246962-0008 WHILE SHE FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF SHAME AND PITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF HAD PURSUED A COURSE WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD AT BEST HAVE RESULTED IN SHUTTING HIM UP AS IN A MADHOUSE
8425-246962-0009 WITH HIS OWN INBORN HORRORS WITH VAIN REMORSE AND EQUALLY VAIN LONGING HER CONSCIENCE NOW THAT HER MIND WAS QUIETER FROM THE GREATER DISTANCE TO WHICH THE THREATENING PERIL HAD AGAIN WITHDRAWN
8425-246962-0010 WITHOUT COMMITTING THE SUICIDE OF SURRENDER SHE COULD NOT SEE THAT CONFESSION WAS THE VERY DOOR OF REFUGE AND SAFETY TOWARDS WHICH HE MUST PRESS GEORGE'S ABSENCE WAS NOW AGAIN A RELIEF
8425-246962-0011 AND WHILE SHE FEARED AND SHRANK FROM THE SEVERITY OF WINGFOLD SHE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN INDISCRIBABLE SENSE OF SAFETY IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST SO LONG AS LEOPOLD WAS TOO ILL TO TALK FOR THE CURATE
8425-246962-0012 HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN THE WOMAN WHO COULD LOVE SO STRONGLY AND YET NOT ENTIRELY WHO SUFFERED AND MUST STILL SUFFER SO MUCH AND WHO A FAITH EVEN NO GREATER THAN HIS OWN MIGHT RENDER COMPARATIVELY BLESSED
8425-246962-0013 BUT TO SO MANY OF THE SECRET CHAMBERS OF THE SOULS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR WHAT A MAN DARES NOT COULD NOT IF HE DARED AND DARED NOT IF HE COULD SAY TO ANOTHER EVEN AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE FITTEST OF ALL
8425-246962-0014 HE CAN SAY THENCE OPEN FACED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND THE PERSON IN NEED THEREOF MAY HEAR IT WITHOUT UMBRAGE OR THE CHOKING HUSK OF INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IRRITATING TO THE REJECTION OF WHAT TRUTH MAY LIE IN IT FOR HIM
8425-246962-0015 THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
8425-246962-0016 IN REGARD TO HELEN LIKE A TRANSPORT SHIP FILLED WITH TROOPS WHICH MUST GO SAILING AROUND THE SHORES OF AN INVADED ALLY
8425-246962-0017 IS IT AN INFIRMITY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEN OR A WISE PROVISION FOR THEIR PROTECTION THAT THE BRIGHTEST FORMS THE TRUTH TAKES IN THEIR PRIVATE COGITATIONS SEEM TO LOSE HALF THEIR LUSTRE
8425-246962-0018 AND ALL THEIR GRACE WHEN UTTERED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNRECEPTIVE NATURE AND THEY HEAR AS IT WERE THEIR OWN VOICE REFLECTED IN A POOR DULL INHARMONIOUS ECHO AND ARE DISGUSTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
8425-246962-0019 OR MISSING HIM GLOOMED BACK INTO THE LAND OF VISIONS THE TENDERNESS OF THE CURATE'S SERVICE THE HEART THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN EVERYTHING HE DID EVEN IN THE TURN AND EXPRESSION OF THE MINISTERING HAND
8425-246962-0020 WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0021 HAD HE NOT GONE FARTHER THAN HIS RIGHT HAD HE NOT IMPLIED MORE CONVICTION THAN WAS HIS WORDS COULD NOT GO BEYOND HIS SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OR THE HOPES FOR THE RANGE OF HIS
8425-246962-0022 CONSCIOUS LIFE SPRINGING THEREFROM BUT WAS HE NOT NOW MAKING PEOPLE SUPPOSE HIM MORE CERTAIN OF THE FACT OF THESE THINGS THAN HE WAS
8425-246962-0023 EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY BY THE DELIGHT OF HIS HEART AS TO GIVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION IT MATTERED LITTLE WHAT WAS IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHAT HE BELIEVED OR HOW HE BELIEVED IF HE HAD NOT BEEN UNTRUE TO HIMSELF
8425-246962-0024 NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
8425-246962-0025 YEA ALL GRAND DISCOVERY FOR THINGS MUST BE FORESEEN ERE THEY CAN BE REALIZED APPREHENDED ERE THEY BE COMPREHENDED THIS MUCH HE COULD SAY FOR HIMSELF AND NO MORE THAT HE WAS READY TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE MERE CHANCE
8425-246962-0026 BUT TO THE TRUTH TO THE LOVELINESS AND HARMONY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SAFETY THAT HE SAW IN THE IDEA OF THE SON OF MAN AS HE READ IT IN THE STORY HE DARED NOT SAY WHAT IN A TIME OF PERSECUTION TORTURE MIGHT WORK UPON HIM
8425-246962-0027 BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-246962-0028 NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM OF THAT LESS THAN THE CONSCIOUS PRESENCE OF THE PERFECT CHARITY WITHOUT THAT HE WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM WANDERING IN A DREAM AROUND ITS WALLS
8425-246962-0029 AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-246962-0030 HE HAD MUCH TIME FOR REFLECTION AS HE SAT SILENT BY THE BEDSIDE OF LEOPOLD SOMETIMES HELEN WOULD BE SITTING NEAR THOUGH GENERALLY WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE WENT OUT FOR HER WALK BUT NEVER ANYTHING CAME TO HIM HE COULD UTTER TO HER
