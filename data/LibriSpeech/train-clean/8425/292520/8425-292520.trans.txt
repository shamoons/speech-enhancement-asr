8425-292520-0000 THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH
8425-292520-0001 PALELY REFLECTED IN THE AMBER COLORED WATER AMONG THEM A CONSTANT BANJO TWANGING OF FROGS AND SHRILLING
8425-292520-0002 DARK WITH CRUMBLING RAILING AND PLANKS THE BRIDGE LEADS INTO THE SUNSET ACROSS IT MANY LONELY FIGURES THEIR EYES A FLARE WITH THE SUNSET THEIR FACES GLOWING WITH ITS COLORS
8425-292520-0003 SALVATION ARMY A DRUM POUNDS OUT THE HYMN LOUD WITH GAUDY ANGELS TINSEL CHERUBIM TO DROWN THE FANFARE OF THE STREET AND WITH EXULTANT LILTING BEAT
8425-292520-0004 AND DINNING MARKET STALLS WHERE WOMEN SHOUT THEIR WARES AND MEAT HANGS OUT GROTESQUE DISTORTED BY THE GAS FLARE'S LIGHT INTO ONE SACRED RHYTHM FOR THE DEVIL'S SPITE A WOMAN'S THIN RAUCOUS VOICE CARRIES THE TUNE BIDS MEN REJOICE
8425-292520-0005 BATHE IN GOD'S MERCY DRAW NEAR AND LEARN SALVATION SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THE MYSTERY CYMBALS AT THE HANDS OF A TIRED GIRL SLIM WISP AMID THE SWIRL OF CROWDED STREETS TAKE UP THE TUNE
8425-292520-0006 FACES ARE WAN IN THE ARC LIGHT'S LIVID GLARE A WIND GUST CARRIES THE BAND'S FLARE OF SONG
8425-292520-0007 TILL WITH DISTANCE DIMMING IT FADES AWAY AMONG THE SILENT DARK ARRAY OF CITY HOUSES WHERE NO SOUL STIRS
8425-292520-0008 AS I GO HASTILY BY IN THE TURBULENT DARKNESS AN OVAL OLIVE FACE WITH THE SWEETLY SULLEN GRACE OF THE VIRGIN WHEN FIRST SHE SEES AMID HER GARDEN'S SILVER LILIES THE WHITE ROBED ANGEL GLEAM
8425-292520-0009 AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE SMOKE AND DUST AGE OLD
8425-292520-0010 AT WHOSE FEET IN TIME OF DEARTH OR NEED A MYRIAD MEN HAVE LAID THEIR SORROWS AND ARISEN BOLD INCESSANTLY THE LONG RAIN FALLS SLANTING ON BLACK WALLS BUT THROUGH THE DARK INTERMINABLE STREETS
8425-292520-0011 ALONG PAVEMENTS WHERE RAIN BEATS ITS SHARP TATTOO AND GAS LAMPS SHINE GREENISH GOLD IN THE SOLITUDE THE VISION FLAMES THROUGH MY MOOD OF THAT ITALIAN WOMAN'S FACE
8425-292520-0012 MEMORY BETWEEN ROUNDED HILLS WHITE WITH PATCHES OF BUCKWHEAT WHOSE FRAGRANCE FILLS THE LITTLE BREEZE THAT MAKES THE BIRCH LEAVES QUIVER BESIDE A ROLLICKING SWIFT RIVER
8425-292520-0013 LIGHT GREEN IN THE DEEPS LIKE YOUR EYES IN SUNSHINE WINDS THE CANAL LAZY AND BROWN AS A WATER SNAKE FULL OF DAZZLE AND SHEEN WHERE THE BREEZE SWEEPS THE WATER WITH GOSSAMER GARMENTS THAT SHAKE THE REEDS STANDING SENTINEL
8425-292520-0014 AND THE MARGINAL LINE OF BIRCHES AND WILLOWS OUR LITTLE STEAMER PULLS ITS WAY WITH JINGLE OF BELLS AND PANTING THROB OF OLD ENGINES IN STIFF ARRAY THE WATER REEDS WAVE AND SOLEMNLY SWAY TO THE WASH AND SWELL OF OUR PASSING
8425-292520-0015 AMONG THE REEDS THE RIPPLES SOB AND DIE AWAY TILL THE CANAL IS STILL AGAIN
8425-292520-0016 I STOOD BESIDE YOU IN THE BOW WATCHED THE SUNLIGHT LOSE ITSELF AMONG YOUR HAIR THAT THE BREEZE TUGGED AT BRIGHT AS THE SHATTERED SUN RAYS WHERE THE PROW CUT THE STILL WATER THE WARM LIGHT CAUGHT AND TANGLED THERE
8425-292520-0017 EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION YOU SMILED WHEN I POINTED WHERE A GROUP OF BIRCHES SHIVERED IN THE GREEN WOOD SHADOW UP TO THEIR KNEES IN WATER
8425-292520-0018 WHITE AND FAIR AS DRYADS BATHING A ROW OF FLAT WHITE HOUSES AND A WHARF GLIDED IN SIGHT THE HOARSE WHISTLE SHRIEKED FOR A LANDING BELLS JANGLED
8425-292520-0019 THE LAKE WAVES WERE FLAKES OF RED GOLD BURNISHED TO COPPER GOLD RED AS THE TANGLED GLEAM OF SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR SATURNALIA
8425-292520-0020 IN MEN'S HEARTS THE MAD GODS RISE AND FILL THE STREETS WITH REVELLING WITH TORCHLIGHT THAT GLANCES ON FROZEN POOLS WITH TAPERS STARRING THE THICK FOGGED NIGHT A DANCE LIKE STRAYED FIREFLIES
8425-292520-0021 TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND
8425-292520-0022 AND PALE VOTARIES SHIVER WITH THE COLD THAT NUMBS THE EARTH AND ETCHES PATTERNED MIRRORS ON THE PONDS WHAN THAT APRILLE
8425-292520-0023 IS IT THE SONG OF A MEADOW LARK OFF THE BROWN SERE SALT MARSHES OR THE EAGER PATCHES IN DOORYARDS OF YELLOW AND PALE LILAC CROCUSES
8425-292520-0024 RHYTHMED CLANK OF TRAIN COUPLINGS AT NIGHT AND THE STORMY GAY TINTED SUNRISES THAT SHADE WITH PURPLE THE CONTOURS OF FAR OFF UNFAMILIAR HILLS NIGHT PIECE
8425-292520-0025 A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB UPON ALL THE SKY WHERE THE FRAIL STARS QUIVER EVERY ONE LIKE TANGLED GNATS THAT HUM AND DIE
8425-292520-0026 THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON
8425-292520-0027 BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS OH THE HOARSE HALF HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
8425-292520-0028 LOW A GREY MOON SHROUDED IN SEA FOG AIR PREGNANT WITH SPRING RASP OF MY STEPS BESIDE THE LAPPING WATER WITHIN THE DARK
8425-292520-0029 DOWN THE WORN OUT YEARS A SOB OF BROKEN LOVES OLD PAIN OF DEAD FAREWELLS AND ONE FACE FADING INTO GREY A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB OVER ALL THE SKY
