8465-246940-0000 IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE EITHER OF THEM SPOKE AND IT DID NOT HELP WINGFOLD THAT SHE SAT CLOUDED BY A DARK COLOURED VEIL AT LENGTH HE SAID YOU MUST NOT FEAR TO TRUST ME BECAUSE I DOUBT MY ABILITY TO HELP YOU I CAN AT LEAST ASSURE YOU OF MY SYMPATHY
8465-246940-0001 CAN YOU TELL ME SHE SAID FROM BEHIND MORE VEILS THAN THAT OF LACE HOW TO GET RID OF A HAUNTING IDEA THAT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE IDEA I SHOULD IMAGINE ANSWERED THE CURATE SUCH THINGS SOMETIMES ARISE MERELY FROM THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
8465-246940-0002 AND THERE THE DOCTOR IS THE BEST HELP HELEN SHOOK HER HEAD AND SMILED BEHIND HER VEIL A GRIEVOUS SMILE THE CURATE PAUSED BUT RECEIVING NO ASSISTANCE VENTURED ON AGAIN IF IT BE A THOUGHT OF SOMETHING PAST AND GONE
8465-246940-0003 FOR WHICH NOTHING CAN BE DONE I THINK ACTIVITY IN ONE'S DAILY WORK MUST BE THE BEST AID TO ENDURANCE OH DEAR OH DEAR SIGHED HELEN WHEN ONE HAS NO HEART TO ENDURE AND HATES THE VERY SUNLIGHT
8465-246940-0004 YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT WORK TO A MAN DYING OF HUNGER WOULD YOU I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT HE WOULDN'T HEED YOU PERHAPS NOT WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN GIVE HIM SOME FOOD AND TRY HIM AGAIN I THINK
8465-246940-0005 THEN GIVE ME SOME FOOD SOME HOPE I MEAN AND TRY ME AGAIN WITHOUT THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT DUTY OR LIFE OR ANYTHING TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
8465-246940-0006 I MAY BE ABLE TO HINT AT SOME HOPE SAID WINGFOLD VERY GENTLY DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN THE QUESTION WOULD TO MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE ABRUPT INQUISITORIAL BUT TO HELEN IT SOUNDED NOT ONE OF THEM ALL
8465-246940-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED AH SAID THE CURATE A LITTLE SADLY AND WENT ON BECAUSE THEN I COULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR COMFORT
8465-246940-0008 MIGHT IT NOT BE WELL HOWEVER TO TRY IF THERE IS ANY TO BE HAD FROM HIM THAT SAID COME UNTO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST I CAN DO NOTHING WITH THAT I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO PRAY BUT IT IS OF NO USE
8465-246940-0009 I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYONE HEARING A WORD I SAY YESTERDAY WHEN I GOT ALONE IN THE PARK I PRAYED ALOUD
8465-246940-0010 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS EVEN IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ WHAT WAS IN MY HEART HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE I WAS EVEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO WISH I KNEW GREEK BECAUSE PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER IF I WERE TO PRAY IN GREEK
8465-246940-0011 SHE TRIED HARD BUT COULD NOT PREVENT A SOB
8465-246940-0012 WILL YOU NOT TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT SAID THE CURATE YET MORE GENTLY
8465-246940-0013 HIS HELP MAY BE ON THE WAY TO YOU OR EVEN WITH YOU ONLY YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS I HAVE KNOWN THAT KIND OF THING TELL ME SOME FACT OR SOME FEELING I CAN LAY HOLD OF
8465-246940-0014 POSSIBLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ARE NOT DOING AND THAT IS WHY YOU CANNOT REST I THINK JESUS WOULD GIVE NO REST EXCEPT IN THE WAY OF LEARNING OF HIM HELEN'S SOBS CEASED
8465-246940-0015 BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY
8465-246940-0016 THAT WAS WHAT MADE ME MISERABLE THEN YOU MUST OF COURSE MAKE ALL POSSIBLE REPARATION ANSWERED WINGFOLD AT ONCE BUT IF NONE WERE POSSIBLE WHAT THEN
8465-246940-0017 HERE THE ANSWER WAS NOT SO PLAIN AND THE CURATE HAD TO THINK AT LEAST HE SAID AT LENGTH YOU COULD CONFESS THE WRONG AND ASK FORGIVENESS
8465-246940-0018 AGAIN THE CURATE TOOK TIME TO REPLY I AM ENDEAVOURING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS I CAN HE SAID BUT IT IS HARD TO DEAL WITH GENERALITIES
8465-246940-0019 YOU SEE HOW USELESS FOR THAT VERY REASON MY ANSWERS HAVE AS YET BEEN STILL I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY AND HESITATE ONLY BECAUSE IT MAY IMPLY MORE CONFIDENCE THAN I DARE PROFESS AND OF ALL THINGS I DREAD UNTRUTH
8465-246940-0020 FOR SURELY THERE CANNOT BE ANY OTHER KIND OF GOD THAN THE FATHER OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246940-0021 THEREFORE SURELY THE FIRST STEP FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COMMITTED SUCH A CRIME MUST BE TO HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE GOD CONFESS THE SIN AND ASK FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING
8465-246940-0022 AND THE CREATURE HE HAS MADE AND IF GOD HEARD THE MAN'S PRAYER AND FORGAVE HIM THEN THE MAN WOULD CERTAINLY KNOW IT IN HIS HEART AND BE CONSOLED PERHAPS BY THE GIFT OF HUMILITY
8465-246940-0023 THEN YOU THINK CONFESSION TO GOD IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IF THERE BE NO ONE ELSE WRONGED TO WHOM CONFESSION CAN BE MADE IF THE CASE WERE MINE
8465-246940-0024 AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
8465-246940-0025 THEN TO FORGIVE AND CONSOLE ME ALAS ALAS THAT HE WILL NOT HEAR OF HE WOULD RATHER BE PUNISHED THAN CONSOLED I FEAR FOR HIS BRAIN BUT INDEED THAT MIGHT BE WELL
8465-246940-0026 SHE HAD GONE MUCH FARTHER THAN SHE HAD INTENDED BUT THE MORE DOUBTFUL HELP BECAME THE MORE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY THE AGONY OF A PERISHING HOPE TO SEARCH THE HEART OF WINGFOLD AGAIN THE CURATE PONDERED ARE YOU SURE HE SAID AT LENGTH
8465-246940-0027 THAT THE PERSON OF WHOM YOU SPEAK IS NOT NEGLECTING SOMETHING HE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING HE KNOWS PERHAPS HE HAD COME BACK TO THE SAME WITH WHICH HE STARTED THROUGH HER VEIL HE SAW HER TURN DEADLY WHITE
8465-246940-0028 EVER SINCE LEOPOLD SAID THE WORD JURY A GHASTLY FEAR HAD HAUNTED HELEN SHE PRESSED HER HAND ON HER HEART AND MADE NO ANSWER I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE THE CURATE WENT ON FROM WHAT ELSE COULD I SPEAK
8465-246940-0029 I KNOW THAT SO LONG AS WE HANG BACK FROM DOING WHAT CONSCIENCE URGES THERE IS NO PEACE FOR US I WILL NOT SAY OUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HEARD FOR MISTER POLWARTH HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THE MOST PRECIOUS ANSWER PRAYER CAN HAVE
8465-246940-0030 LIES IN THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE TOWARDS THE DREADED DUTY AND IN THE EVER SHARPER STINGS OF THE CONSCIENCE I THINK I ASKED ALREADY WHETHER THERE WERE NO RELATIVES TO WHOM REPARATION COULD BE MADE YES YES GASPED HELEN
8465-246940-0031 AND I TOLD YOU REPARATION WAS IMPOSSIBLE HER VOICE HAD SUNK ALMOST TO A GROAN
