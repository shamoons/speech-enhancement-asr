8465-246942-0000 SHE HAD SOUGHT THE DOOR OF PARADISE AND THE DOOR OF HELL HAD BEEN OPENED TO HER IF THE FRIGHTFUL IDEA WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT HAD ALREADY SUGGESTED ITSELF TO LEOPOLD SHOULD NOW BE ENCOURAGED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK MADNESS BEFORE HER
8465-246942-0001 HER POLDIE ON THE SCAFFOLD GOD IN HEAVEN INFINITELY RATHER WOULD SHE POISON HERSELF AND HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW PLEASED AND CONSOLED HE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR DYING TOGETHER AND THAT REASSURED HER A LITTLE
8465-246942-0002 BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
8465-246942-0003 HELEN'S ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF GUILT CAME FROM THE PALE IMAGE OF IT LIFTED ABOVE HER HORIZON BY THE REFRACTION OF HER SYMPATHY SHE DID NOT KNOW PERHAPS NEVER WOULD UNDERSTAND THE GHASTLY HORROR OF CONSCIOUS GUILT BESIDES WHICH THERE IS NO EVIL ELSE
8465-246942-0004 AGONIES OF INJURY A MAN MAY ENDURE AND SO FAR FROM BEING OVERWHELMED RISE ABOVE THEM TENFOLD A MAN WHO WERE HE TO AWAKE TO THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF A CRIME WOULD SINK INTO A HEAP OF RUIN
8465-246942-0005 THEN INDEED IF THERE BE NO GOD OR ONE THAT HAS NOT AN INFINITE POWER OF SETTING RIGHT THAT WHICH HAS GONE WRONG WITH HIS WORK THEN INDEED WELCOME THE FAITH FOR FAITH IT MAY THEN BE CALLED OF SUCH AS SAY THERE IS NO HEREAFTER
8465-246942-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0007 AND SOME KIND OF REFUGE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STRANGE IT IS AND TRUE THAT IN PUBLICITY ITSELF LIES SOME RELIEF FROM THE GNAWING OF THE WORM AS IF EVEN A CURSING HUMANITY WERE A BARRIER OF PROTECTION BETWEEN THE TORN SOUL AND ITS CRIME
8465-246942-0008 IT FLEES TO ITS KIND FOR SHELTER FROM ITSELF HENCE I IMAGINE IN PART MAY THE COOLNESS OF SOME CRIMINALS BE ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR QUIETNESS IS THE RELIEF BROUGHT BY CONFESSION EVEN CONFESSION BUT TO THEIR FELLOWS
8465-246942-0009 IS IT THAT THE CRIME SEEMS THEN LIFTED A LITTLE FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND ITS WEIGHT SHARED BY THE ACE HELEN HAD HOPED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IN PUBLIC SO TENDERLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SO POWERFULLY OF THE SAVING HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
8465-246942-0010 THAT WOULD HAVE NO DIVISIONS OF PRIDE NO SCATTERINGS OF HATE
8465-246942-0011 WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HOME IN GLADNESS TO HER SICK SOULED BROTHER TO COMFORT AND STRENGTHEN HIM
8465-246942-0012 AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT AFTER ALL THERE WAS YET A PLACE FOR HIM IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT HE WAS NO OUTCAST OF GEHENNA BUT INSTEAD OF SUCH WORDS OF GENTLE MIGHT LIKE THOSE OF THE MAN OF WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF TALKING
8465-246942-0013 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0014 SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
8465-246942-0015 IF LEOPOLD HAD HAD HER MOTHER FOR HIS TOO INSTEAD OF THE DARK SKINNED WOMAN WITH THE FLASHING EYES HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON THEM IT WAS ALL HIS MOTHER'S FAULT THE FAULT OF HER RACE AND OF THE HORRIBLE DRUG HER PEOPLE HAD TAUGHT HIM TO TAKE
8465-246942-0016 AND WAS HE TO GO AND CONFESS IT AND BE TRIED FOR IT AND BE GREAT GOD AND HERE WAS THE PRIEST ACTUALLY COUNSELLING WHAT WAS WORSE THAN ANY SUICIDE
8465-246942-0017 SUDDENLY HOWEVER IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE CURATE HAD HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN COMPELLED TO TALK AT RANDOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUSPECT THE CRIME OF WHICH HER BROTHER HAD BEEN GUILTY
8465-246942-0018 AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
8465-246942-0019 BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
8465-246942-0020 NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
8465-246942-0021 ALAS ALAS SHE WAS ALONE ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE GREAT WASTE DEATH EYED UNIVERSE BUT FOR A MAN TO TALK SO OF THE TENDERNESS OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246942-0022 AND THEN SERVE HER AS THE CURATE HAD DONE IT WAS INDEED SHAMELESS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TREATED A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND AS SHE SAID THUS TO HERSELF AGAIN THE WORDS SOUNDED IN THE EAR OF HER HEART
8465-246942-0023 COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST WHENCE CAME THE VOICE FROM HER MEMORY OR FROM THAT INNER CHAMBER OF THE SPIRIT WHICH THE ONE SPIRIT BEARING SPIRIT
8465-246942-0024 KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
8465-246942-0025 BUT WHAT MATTER WHERE THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID THEM SO LONG AS THE WORDS WERE TRUE AND SHE MIGHT BELIEVE THEM WHATEVER IS TRUE CAN BE BELIEVED OF THE TRUE HEART ERE SHE KNEW
8465-246942-0026 HELEN WAS ON HER KNEES WITH HER HEAD ON THE CHAIR YET ONCE MORE CRYING TO THE HEARER OF CRIES POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE BEING SHE KNEW NOT IN THE LEAST BUT WORDS REPORTED OF HIM HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE CRY TO HELP HER IN HER DIRE NEED
8465-246942-0027 INSTEAD OF ANY WORD OR THOUGHT EVEN COMING TO HER THAT MIGHT BE FANCIED AN ANSWER SHE WAS SCARED FROM HER KNEES BY AN APPROACHING STEP
