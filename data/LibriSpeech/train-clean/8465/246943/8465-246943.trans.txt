8465-246943-0000 HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
8465-246943-0001 THAT GLIMMER ON HIS COUNTENANCE DOUBTFUL AS THE FIRST OF THE MORNING WHEN THE TRAVELLER KNOWS NOT WHETHER THE LIGHT BE IN THE SKY OR ONLY IN HIS BRAIN
8465-246943-0002 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
8465-246943-0003 WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
8465-246943-0004 DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
8465-246943-0005 WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
8465-246943-0006 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0007 OH I WISH I HADN'T RUN AWAY BUT HAD LET THEM TAKE ME AND HANG ME HELEN FELT HERSELF GROW WHITE SHE TURNED AWAY AND PRETENDED TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED
8465-246943-0008 I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU SHE SAID STILL STOOPING AND SHE FELT LIKE A DEVIL DRAGGING THE SOUL OF HER BROTHER TO HELL BUT THAT WAS A FOOLISH FANCY AND MUST BE RESISTED
8465-246943-0009 NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
8465-246943-0010 WHAT IS HE THERE FOR THEN SAID LEOPOLD INDIGNANTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND MOANED HELEN HAD NOT YET THOUGHT OF ASKING HERSELF WHETHER HER LOVE TO HER BROTHER WAS ALL CLEAR LOVE AND NOWISE MINGLED WITH SELFISHNESS
8465-246943-0011 WHETHER IN THE FRESH HORROR THAT DAY POURED INTO THE CUP THAT HAD SEEMED ALREADY RUNNING OVER IT WAS OF HER BROTHER ONLY SHE THOUGHT OR WHETHER THREATENED SHAME TO HERSELF HAD NOT A PART IN HER MISERY
8465-246943-0012 FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
8465-246943-0013 INDEED WAS SHE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUCH A MAN BRINGING THE ARTILLERY OF HIS FANATICISM TO BEAR UPON HER POOR BOY'S WILD ENTHUSIASTIC TEMPERAMENT WOULD SPEEDILY PERSUADE HIM TO MAKE A REALITY OF THAT TERRIBLE THING HE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT HIDEOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY
8465-246943-0014 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG SHE THOUGHT
8465-246943-0015 APPARENTLY SENSELESS ON THE PILLOW AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD THE SAME MOMENT SHE WAS FREE THE HORROR HAD DEPARTED FROM HER OWN ATMOSPHERE TOO AND SHE MADE HASTE TO RESTORE HIM
8465-246943-0016 BUT IN ALL SHE DID FOR HIM SHE FELT LIKE THE EXECUTIONER WHO GIVES RESTORATIVES TO THE WRETCH THAT HAS FAINTED ON THE RACK OR THE WHEEL WHAT RIGHT HAD SHE SHE THOUGHT TO MULTIPLY TO HIM HIS MOMENTS OF TORTURE
8465-246943-0017 IF THE CRUEL POWER THAT HAD CREATED HIM FOR SUCH MISERY WHOEVER WHATEVER WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
8465-246943-0018 YET SHE HESITATED NOT A SINGLE MOMENT IN HER MINISTRATIONS THERE IS SO MUCH PASSES IN US OF WHICH OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TAKES NO GRASP OR BUT WITH SUCH A FLITTING TOUCH AS SCARCELY TO HAND IT OVER TO THE MEMORY
8465-246943-0019 THAT I FEEL ENCOURAGED TO DOUBT WHETHER EVER THERE WAS A MAN ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HOPE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ALAS ARE MANY WHO ARE AWARE OF NO GROUND OF HOPE NAY EVEN WHO FEEL NO GLIMMER IN THEM OF ANYTHING THEY CAN CALL HOPE I KNOW
8465-246943-0020 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246943-0021 AT LENGTH LEOPOLD OPENED HIS EYES
8465-246943-0022 NONSENSE DEAR POLDIE IT WAS ALL FANCY NOTHING MORE SHE RETURNED IN A VOICE ALMOST AS HOLLOW AS HIS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF THE WORDS UTTERED IN SUCH A TONE JARRED DISMAYFULLY ON HER OWN EAR FANCY HE REPEATED
8465-246943-0023 I KNOW WHAT FANCY IS AS WELL AS ANY MAN OR WOMAN BORN THAT WAS NO FANCY SHE STOOD THERE BY THE WARDROBE IN THE SAME DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS HER DRESS AND LISTEN I WILL TELL YOU
8465-246943-0024 I WILL SOON SATISFY YOU IT COULD BE NO FANCY HERE HE PUSHED HER FROM HIM AND LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER EYES I SAW HER BACK REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR OF THE WARDROBE DOOR AND
8465-246943-0025 HERE THE FIXED LOOK OF HORROR THREATENED TO RETURN UPON HIS FACE BUT HE WENT ON LISTEN
8465-246943-0026 UGH I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR HIS VOICE HAD RISEN TO A STRANGLED SHRIEK HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED
8465-246943-0027 IF INDEED THAT BE A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF COURAGE AND IT IS NOT GATHERED RATHER FROM THE HIDDEN HOPE OF WHICH I SPEAK AND THE LOVE THAT WILL CLEAVE AND NOT FORSAKE SHE SET HER TEETH AND SAID LET HER COME THEN POLDIE I AM WITH YOU AND I DEFY HER
8465-246943-0028 SHE SHALL KNOW THAT A SISTER'S LOVE IS STRONGER THAN THE HATE OF A JILT EVEN IF YOU DID KILL HER BEFORE GOD POLDIE I WOULD AFTER ALL RATHER BE YOU THAN SHE SAY WHAT YOU WILL
8465-246943-0029 BUT LEOPOLD SEEMED NOT TO HEAR A WORD SHE SAID AND LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL
