8465-246947-0000 AS WINGFOLD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH WAS NEAR THE STAIR HELEN ROSE FROM THE TOP OF IT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN WITH HER BROTHER HE CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM AND STEPPED SOFTLY ALONG THE LANDING
8465-246947-0001 A HUMAN SOUL IN GUILT AND AGONY IS AN AWFUL PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE HUSH OF THE CURATE HE FELT AS IF HE HAD LEFT THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS BEHIND HIM AT THE BEDSIDE
8465-246947-0002 BUT AT HIS HEAD STOOD ONE WHO WATCHED HIS THROES WITH THE THROBS OF SUCH A HUMAN HEART AS NEVER BEAT IN ANY BOSOM BUT HIS OWN AND THE EXECUTIONERS WERE ANGELS OF LIGHT NO WONDER IF WITH SUCH A FEELING IN HIS BREAST WINGFOLD WALKED SOFTLY AND HIS FACE GLISTENED
8465-246947-0003 HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES BUT HELEN SAW THEM YOU KNOW ALL SHE FALTERED I DO WILL YOU LET ME OUT BY THE GARDEN AGAIN I WISH TO BE ALONE SHE LED THE WAY DOWN THE STAIR
8465-246947-0004 AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
8465-246947-0005 I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
8465-246947-0006 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8465-246947-0007 INTO THE LIFE I HOPE YOUR BROTHER WILL ENTER I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T HATE HIM HATE HIM WHO BUT A DEMON COULD HATE HIM HELEN LIFTED A GRATEFUL LOOK FROM EYES THAT SWAM IN TEARS
8465-246947-0008 THE TERROR OF HIS POSSIBLE COUNSEL FOR THE MOMENT VANISHED HE COULD NEVER TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP
8465-246947-0009 THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
8465-246947-0010 HE IS THE WISEST AND BEST MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN I MUST ASK LEOPOLD RETURNED HELEN WHO THE BETTER THE MAN WAS REPRESENTED FELT THE MORE JEALOUS AND FEARFUL OF THE ADVICE HE MIGHT GIVE
8465-246947-0011 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0012 COULD IT BE THAT WINGFOLD'S BEARING HAD COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND A SHADOW OF THE AWE WITH WHICH HE HAD LEFT THE PLACE WHERE PERHAPS A SOUL WAS BEING BORN AGAIN LEOPOLD DID NOT MOVE TERROR LAID HOLD OF HER HEART
8465-246947-0013 SHE STEPPED QUICKLY IN AND ROUND THE SCREEN TO THE SIDE OF THE BED THERE TO HER GLAD SURPRISE HE LAY FAST ASLEEP WITH THE TEARS NOT YET DRIED UPON HIS FACE HER HEART SWELLED WITH SOME SENSE UNKNOWN BEFORE
8465-246947-0014 WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
8465-246947-0015 I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
8465-246947-0016 DID GOD MAKE ME SLEEP HELEN SHE DID NOT ANSWER THE LIGHT OF A NEW HOPE IN HIS EYE AS IF THE DAWN HAD BEGUN AT LAST TO BREAK OVER THE DARK MOUNTAINS WAS ALREADY REFLECTED FROM HER HEART OH HELEN HE SAID
8465-246947-0017 THAT IS A GOOD FELLOW SUCH A GOOD FELLOW A PANG OF JEALOUSY THE FIRST SHE HAD EVER FELT SHOT TO HER HEART SHE HAD HITHERTO SINCE HIS TROUBLE BEEN ALL IN ALL TO HER LEOPOLD
8465-246947-0018 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8465-246947-0019 I KNOW I TOOK TO YOU AT FIRST SIGHT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A LONELY LITTLE FOREIGNER AND YOU A GREAT BEAUTIFUL LADY FOR SUCH YOU SEEMED TO ME THOUGH YOU HAVE TOLD ME SINCE YOU WERE ONLY A GREAT GAWKY GIRL
8465-246947-0020 I KNOW THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOU RAN TO MEET ME AND TOOK ME IN YOUR ARMS AND KISSED ME I WAS AS IF I HAD CROSSED THE SEA OF DEATH AND FOUND PARADISE IN YOUR BOSOM I AM NOT LIKELY TO FORGET YOU FOR MISTER WINGFOLD
8465-246947-0021 GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
8465-246947-0022 BUT YOU WILL IN TIME YOU SEE HE'S NOT ONE TO PAY YOUNG LADIES COMPLIMENTS AS I HAVE HEARD SOME PARSONS DO AND HE MAY BE A LITTLE NO NOT UNPOLISHED NOT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN BUT UNORNAMENTAL IN HIS MANNERS
8465-246947-0023 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED LEOPOLD BUT THEN HE CAME TO ME WITH HIS DOOR OPEN AND LET ME WALK IN
8465-246947-0024 HE HASN'T GOT A SECRET LIKE US HELEN HE ADDED SADLY WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU MUCH WHAT HE SAID TO YOU FROM THE PULPIT THE OTHER DAY I SHOULD THINK THEN SHE WAS RIGHT FOR ALL HIS HARDNESS AND WANT OF SYMPATHY THE CURATE HAD YET HAD REGARD TO HER ENTREATIES
8465-246947-0025 AND WAS NOT GOING TO PUT ANY HORRID NOTIONS ABOUT DUTY AND SELF SACRIFICE INTO THE POOR BOY'S HEAD HE'S COMING AGAIN TO MORROW ADDED LEOPOLD ALMOST GLEEFULLY AND THEN PERHAPS HE WILL TELL ME MORE AND HELP ME ON A BIT DID HE TELL YOU HE WANTS TO BRING A FRIEND WITH HIM
8465-246947-0026 NO I CAN'T SEE THE GOOD OF TAKING MORE PEOPLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE WHY SHOULD HE NOT DO WHAT HE THINKS BEST HELEN YOU DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE DOCTOR WHY SHOULD YOU WITH HIM WHEN A MAN IS GOING TO THE BOTTOM AS FAST AS HE CAN
8465-246947-0027 AND ANOTHER COMES DIVING AFTER HIM IT ISN'T FOR ME TO SAY HOW HE IS TO TAKE HOLD OF ME NO HELEN WHEN I TRUST I TRUST OUT AND OUT HELEN SIGHED THINKING HOW ILL THAT HAD WORKED WITH EMMELINE
