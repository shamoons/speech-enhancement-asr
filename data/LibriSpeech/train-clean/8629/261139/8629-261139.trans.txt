8629-261139-0000 ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
8629-261139-0001 IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
8629-261139-0002 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
8629-261139-0003 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
8629-261139-0004 FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0006 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
8629-261139-0007 LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8629-261139-0008 FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
8629-261139-0009 AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
8629-261139-0010 AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
8629-261139-0011 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
8629-261139-0012 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
8629-261139-0013 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
8629-261139-0014 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
8629-261139-0015 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
8629-261139-0016 AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
8629-261139-0017 THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0019 WHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABEL
8629-261139-0020 WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
8629-261139-0021 EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
8629-261139-0022 EVER FORGOT THOUGH IT CONVEYED NO HINT OF HER REAL FEELINGS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC FREDERICK WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER NOW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK WAITED FOR THE CORONER'S REPLY IF YOU HAVE TESTIMONY
8629-261139-0023 SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
8629-261139-0024 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
8629-261139-0025 GO HE WHISPERED BUT IN SO THRILLING A TONE IT WAS HEARD TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE ROOM SPARE ME THE ANGUISH OF SAYING WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IN YOUR PRESENCE I COULD NOT BEAR IT YOU COULD NOT BEAR IT LATER
8629-261139-0026 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
8629-261139-0027 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
8629-261139-0028 DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
8629-261139-0029 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
8629-261139-0030 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
8629-261139-0031 AND THE SHOCK THE SURPRISE
8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0033 THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
8629-261139-0034 ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
8629-261139-0035 HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
8629-261139-0036 HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
8629-261139-0037 BUT IF ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO ME THINKS ME GUILTY OF THE DEATH I WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE WITNESSED
8629-261139-0038 DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
8629-261139-0039 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
8629-261139-0040 SHE WAS TOO GOOD IT'S ALL CALUMNY A WRETCHED LIE BROKE IN UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT FROM EVERY PART OF THE LARGE ROOM IN VAIN THE CORONER SMOTE WITH HIS GAVEL IN VAIN THE LOCAL POLICE ENDEAVOURED TO RESTORE ORDER
8629-261139-0041 THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
8629-261139-0042 OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
8629-261139-0043 I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
8629-261139-0044 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
8629-261139-0045 YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
8629-261139-0046 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
8629-261139-0048 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
8629-261139-0049 AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
8629-261139-0050 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
8629-261139-0051 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
8629-261139-0052 HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
8629-261139-0054 BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
8629-261139-0055 OR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THIS
8629-261139-0056 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
8629-261139-0057 I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
8629-261139-0058 THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
8629-261139-0059 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
8629-261139-0061 NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
8629-261139-0062 I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
8629-261139-0063 FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
8629-261139-0064 IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
8629-261139-0065 DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
8629-261139-0066 GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
8629-261139-0067 BUT SHE MISTOOK THE ACTION MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND
8629-261139-0068 MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
8629-261139-0069 AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
8629-261139-0070 SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
8629-261139-0071 WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
8629-261139-0072 THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
8629-261139-0073 THERE IS NO BLOOD ON YOU SHE MURMURED YOU DID NOT STRIKE THE BLOW
8629-261139-0074 THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
8629-261139-0075 DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
8629-261139-0076 THAT UNKNOWN TO ME UNKNOWN TO ANYONE LIVING BUT HERSELF UNKNOWN TO THAT GOOD MAN FROM WHOM IT CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT HIDDEN AGATHA WEBB WAS MY MOTHER
