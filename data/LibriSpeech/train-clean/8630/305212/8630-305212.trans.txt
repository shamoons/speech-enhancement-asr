8630-305212-0000 CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
8630-305212-0001 HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
8630-305212-0002 DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0003 AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE WORSE THAN HE REALLY WAS LEST HIS PRESTIGE SHOULD SUFFER IN THEIR EYES THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE LOATHED IT ALL AND LONGED FOR THE OLD LIFE WITH ITS INNOCENT PLEASURES
8630-305212-0004 BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0005 BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD THEY DID NOT CARE TO EAT THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE PIGS IT WAS NOT SCHOOLBOY GREED THAT PROMPTED THE THEFT BUT THE PURE DELIGHT OF DOING EVIL
8630-305212-0006 OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
8630-305212-0007 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0008 THE OLD PAGAN WAYS SEEMED ONLY NATURAL HE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHED AT THE FACT THAT HIS SON'S BOYHOOD WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT HIS OWN HAD BEEN HE WAS STANDING IT IS TRUE ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH
8630-305212-0009 BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0010 THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0011 AND MARVELLED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GRACE OF BAPTISM WAS THAT INDEED HIS MOTHER HE ASKED HIMSELF THAT GENTLE PATIENT OLD WOMAN SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO READY TO GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
8630-305212-0012 SHE HAD USED TO BE VIOLENT AND HEADSTRONG LIKE HIMSELF RESENTFUL AND IMPLACABLE IN HER DISLIKES BUT NOW SHE WAS MORE LIKE MONICA THAN LIKE HIM THAT WAS MONICA'S WAY THOUGH HER SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE
8630-305212-0013 SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0014 SELF CONQUEST WAS THE HARDEST TASK THAT HE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN AND SOMETIMES HE ALMOST LOST HEART AND WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IT UP ALTOGETHER THEN MONICA WOULD GENTLY REMIND HIM
8630-305212-0015 THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0017 GOD DID NOT MIND THEM AND THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTING REFLECTION FOR POOR WEAK PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF TO GO ON TRYING WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR HIM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HE COULD NOT ALWAYS PROMISE HIMSELF SUCCESS
8630-305212-0018 PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0019 HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD COST A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ROMANIANUS
8630-305212-0020 WHO KNEW THE POVERTY OF HIS FRIEND CAME FORWARD GENEROUSLY AND PUT HIS PURSE AT PATRICIUS'S DISPOSAL THE SUM REQUIRED WAS OFFERED WITH SUCH DELICACY THAT IT COULD NOT BE DECLINED AUGUSTINE WAS SURE TO BRING GLORY ON HIS NATIVE TOWN
8630-305212-0021 SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022 TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0023 IT WAS HER ONLY HOPE NOW AS WITH PRAYERS AND TEARS SHE BESOUGHT OF HIM TO WATCH OVER HER SON BUT MONICA DID NOT KNOW CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0024 IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED
8630-305212-0025 THE BLOODY COMBATS BETWEEN MEN AND BEASTS THE GLADIATORIAL SHOWS THAT DELIGHTED THE ROMANS WERE FREE TO ALL WHO CHOSE TO FREQUENT THE AMPHITHEATRE OF CARTHAGE SUCH PLAYS AS THE ROMANS DELIGHTED IN
8630-305212-0026 IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WERE ACTED IN THE THEATRE THE HORRIBLE RITES OF THE EASTERN RELIGIONS WERE PRACTISED OPENLY THERE WAS NEITHER DISCIPLINE NOR ORDER IN THE SCHOOLS
8630-305212-0027 THE WEALTHIER STUDENTS GLORIED IN THEIR BAD REPUTATION THEY WERE YOUNG MEN OF FASHION WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING AND WHO WERE CAREFUL TO LET OTHERS KNOW IT THEY WENT BY THE NAME OF SMASHERS OR UPSETTERS
8630-305212-0028 FROM THEIR HABIT OF RAIDING THE SCHOOLS OF PROFESSORS WHOSE TEACHING THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND BREAKING EVERYTHING ON WHICH THEY COULD LAY HANDS THEY TREATED NEW COMERS WITH COARSE BRUTALITY BUT AUGUSTINE SEEMS IN SOME MANNER
8630-305212-0029 TO HAVE ESCAPED THEIR ENMITY PERHAPS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S BEARING OR PERHAPS HIS BRILLIANT GIFTS WON THEIR RESPECT FOR HE SURPASSED THEM ALL IN INTELLIGENCE AND SPEEDILY OUTSTRIPPED THEM IN CLASS
8630-305212-0030 AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY
8630-305212-0031 MY GOD HE CRIED IN LATER YEARS WITH WHAT BITTER GALL DIDST THOU IN THY GREAT MERCY SPRINKLE THOSE PLEASURES OF MINE HE COULD NOT FORGET
8630-305212-0032 PATRICIUS PRAYED WITH HER HE UNDERSTOOD AT LAST EVERY DAY THE GERMS OF A NOBLE NATURE THAT HAD LAIN SO LONG DORMANT WITHIN HIM WERE GAINING STRENGTH AND LIFE
8630-305212-0033 EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
8630-305212-0034 THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
8630-305212-0035 HIS MOTHER HAD ALREADY SHOWN HIM THE JOYS OF A CHRISTIAN DEATHBED SHE HAD PASSED AWAY SMILING WITH THEIR HANDS IN HERS AND THE NAME OF JESUS ON HER LIPS
8630-305212-0036 THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH
8630-305212-0037 AND TO BE WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR EVERLASTING HOME BUT MONICA'S HAPPINESS WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED FOR IT SEEMED THAT PATRICIUS WOULD SOON REJOIN HIS MOTHER
8630-305212-0038 HE DID NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF HE SPOKE OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH TO MONICA AND ASKED HER TO HELP HIM TO MAKE A WORTHY PREPARATION FOR BAPTISM WHICH HE DESIRED TO RECEIVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8630-305212-0039 WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND TRUSTFULNESS OF A CHILD HE LOOKED TO HER FOR GUIDANCE AND DID ALL THAT SHE DESIRED THE CEREMONY OVER HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SMILED
8630-305212-0040 A WONDERFUL PEACE POSSESSED HIM THE OLD LIFE WITH ALL ITS STAINS HAD PASSED FROM HIM IN THOSE CLEANSING WATERS THE NEW LIFE WAS AT HAND ONCE MORE HE ASKED HER
8630-305212-0041 TO FORGIVE HIM ALL THE PAIN HE HAD CAUSED HER ALL THAT HE HAD MADE HER SUFFER NO SHE MUST NOT GRIEVE HE TOLD HER THE PARTING WOULD BE BUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE MEETING FOR ALL ETERNITY
8630-305212-0042 SHE HAD BEEN HIS ANGEL HE SAID HE OWED ALL HIS JOY TO HER IT WAS HER LOVE HER PATIENCE THAT HAD DONE IT ALL SHE HAD SHOWN HIM THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS AND MADE HIM LOVE IT
8630-305212-0043 HE THANKED HER FOR ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD SHOWN HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM HER TEARS FELL ON HIS FACE HER LOVING ARMS SUPPORTED HIM HER SWEET VOICE BROKEN WITH WEEPING
8630-305212-0044 SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
