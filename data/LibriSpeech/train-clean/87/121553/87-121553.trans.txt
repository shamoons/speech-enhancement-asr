87-121553-0000 AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
87-121553-0001 WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
87-121553-0002 AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
87-121553-0003 OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
87-121553-0004 TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
87-121553-0005 WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
87-121553-0006 WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0008 AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
87-121553-0009 THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
87-121553-0010 DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
87-121553-0011 SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
87-121553-0012 NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
87-121553-0013 NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
87-121553-0014 HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
87-121553-0015 AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
87-121553-0016 IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
87-121553-0017 BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
87-121553-0018 I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
87-121553-0019 WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
87-121553-0020 AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
87-121553-0021 HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
87-121553-0022 LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
87-121553-0023 THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
87-121553-0024 THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
87-121553-0025 AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
87-121553-0026 THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
87-121553-0027 THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
87-121553-0028 WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
87-121553-0029 AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
87-121553-0030 ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
87-121553-0031 WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
87-121553-0032 AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
87-121553-0033 IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
87-121553-0034 NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
87-121553-0035 THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
87-121553-0036 OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
87-121553-0037 AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
87-121553-0038 BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
87-121553-0039 AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
87-121553-0040 THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
87-121553-0041 FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
87-121553-0042 AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
87-121553-0043 THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
87-121553-0044 AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
87-121553-0045 SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
87-121553-0046 THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
87-121553-0047 ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
87-121553-0048 FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
87-121553-0049 NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
87-121553-0050 NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
87-121553-0051 SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
87-121553-0052 BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
87-121553-0053 WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
87-121553-0054 AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
87-121553-0055 EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
87-121553-0056 HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
87-121553-0057 SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
87-121553-0058 SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
87-121553-0059 BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
87-121553-0060 A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
87-121553-0061 THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
87-121553-0062 WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
87-121553-0063 AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
87-121553-0064 SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
87-121553-0065 THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
87-121553-0066 AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
87-121553-0067 WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
87-121553-0068 BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
87-121553-0069 WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
87-121553-0070 BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
87-121553-0071 OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
87-121553-0072 DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
87-121553-0073 THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
87-121553-0074 AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
87-121553-0075 FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
87-121553-0076 NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
87-121553-0077 WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
87-121553-0078 AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
87-121553-0079 ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
87-121553-0080 AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
87-121553-0081 MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
87-121553-0082 I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
87-121553-0083 O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
87-121553-0084 I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
87-121553-0085 WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
87-121553-0086 AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
87-121553-0087 THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
87-121553-0088 AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
87-121553-0089 FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
87-121553-0090 FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
87-121553-0091 BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
87-121553-0092 AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
87-121553-0093 SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
87-121553-0094 THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
87-121553-0095 IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
87-121553-0096 SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
87-121553-0097 IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
87-121553-0098 EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
87-121553-0099 THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
87-121553-0100 AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
87-121553-0101 THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
87-121553-0102 SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
87-121553-0103 ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
87-121553-0104 I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
87-121553-0105 KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
87-121553-0106 MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
87-121553-0107 WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
