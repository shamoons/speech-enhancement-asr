89-218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0001 THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0002 HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
89-218-0003 AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
89-218-0004 AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
89-218-0005 PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0006 IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
89-218-0007 BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0008 BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
89-218-0009 WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
89-218-0010 BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
89-218-0011 AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0012 SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
89-218-0013 AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0014 ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0015 SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
89-218-0016 CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0017 FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
89-218-0018 AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
89-218-0019 WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020 TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0021 AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
89-218-0022 ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0023 THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
89-218-0024 THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
89-218-0025 MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
89-218-0026 IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
89-218-0027 THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0028 YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0029 AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-218-0030 HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
89-218-0031 SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
89-218-0032 AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0033 I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
89-218-0034 A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
89-218-0035 AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0036 SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
89-218-0037 IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
89-218-0038 BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
89-218-0039 BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
89-218-0040 ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
89-218-0041 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0042 TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
89-218-0043 AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044 AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0045 A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
89-218-0046 HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0047 AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
89-218-0048 HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
89-218-0049 SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
89-218-0050 AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0051 A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
89-218-0052 A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0053 STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
89-218-0054 TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
89-218-0055 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0056 BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
89-218-0057 AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
