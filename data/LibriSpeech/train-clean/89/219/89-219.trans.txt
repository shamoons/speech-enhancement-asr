89-219-0000 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001 SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0002 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0003 IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005 TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0006 FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0008 AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010 AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0011 AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0012 BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013 MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0014 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016 HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0017 HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
89-219-0018 SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019 OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0020 I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0023 BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0024 HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0026 AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029 HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0030 CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0032 IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0033 AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0035 THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
89-219-0036 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037 THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0038 AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0041 WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
89-219-0042 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043 HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0044 HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
89-219-0045 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046 SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0047 IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049 AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0050 OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
89-219-0051 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052 ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0053 MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0054 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0056 WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
89-219-0057 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058 HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0059 SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0062 SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064 THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
