909-131045-0000 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0003 THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0006 THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
909-131045-0007 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0009 THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0012 THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
909-131045-0013 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0014 IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
909-131045-0015 AND MUST COMMIT THAT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION TO HANDS WHICH MIGHT BE UNEQUAL OR UNFRIENDLY TO THE TASK THE MOST TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE GENERALITY OF MEN IN SUCH A SITUATION IS THE NEGATIVE MERIT OF NOT DOING HARM
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0017 AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
909-131045-0018 TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0021 BUT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF APPROACHING AN INEVITABLE ANNIHILATION HIS AVARICE WOULD BE LIKELY TO GET THE VICTORY OVER HIS CAUTION HIS VANITY OR HIS AMBITION AN AMBITIOUS MAN TOO
909-131045-0022 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
909-131045-0023 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0024 IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE THAT EXPERIENCE IS THE PARENT OF WISDOM IS AN ADAGE THE TRUTH OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE WISEST AS WELL AS THE SIMPLEST OF MANKIND WHAT MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN THIS QUALITY IN THE GOVERNORS OF NATIONS
909-131045-0025 WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0027 BY THE CHOICE OF THEIR FELLOWCITIZENS AFTER THEY HAVE BY A COURSE OF SERVICE FITTED THEMSELVES FOR DOING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF UTILITY A FOURTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE BANISHING MEN FROM STATIONS IN WHICH
909-131045-0028 IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
909-131045-0029 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0030 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0031 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0032 A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
909-131045-0033 IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
909-131045-0034 AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
909-131045-0035 THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
909-131045-0036 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0039 ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
909-131045-0040 AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
909-131045-0041 WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
909-131045-0042 THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
909-131045-0043 BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
