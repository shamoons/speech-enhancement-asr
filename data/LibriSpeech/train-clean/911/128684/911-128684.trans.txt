911-128684-0000 ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
911-128684-0001 OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
911-128684-0002 IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
911-128684-0003 THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
911-128684-0004 CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
911-128684-0005 IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
911-128684-0006 A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
911-128684-0007 BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
911-128684-0008 THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
911-128684-0009 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0010 HERE WHATEVER IS HARD INTERFERES WITH THE SPACE ITS NEIGHBORS OCCUPY IT DENTS THEM IS IMPENETRABLE BY THEM AND WE CALL THE HARDNESS THEN A PHYSICAL HARDNESS
911-128684-0011 IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
911-128684-0012 TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
911-128684-0013 THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
911-128684-0014 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0015 BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
911-128684-0016 IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0017 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0018 IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
911-128684-0019 IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0020 BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
911-128684-0021 IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
911-128684-0022 THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
911-128684-0023 CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
911-128684-0024 IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
911-128684-0025 SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT
911-128684-0026 THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
911-128684-0027 WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
911-128684-0028 THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
911-128684-0029 AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
911-128684-0030 OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
911-128684-0031 OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED
911-128684-0032 AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
911-128684-0033 MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
911-128684-0034 WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY
911-128684-0035 AN AGREEABLE DEGREE OF HEAT OR AN AGREEABLE FEELING OCCASIONED BY THE DEGREE OF HEAT EITHER WILL DO AND LANGUAGE WOULD LOSE MOST OF ITS ESTHETIC AND RHETORICAL VALUE
911-128684-0036 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0037 ALL IN THEMSELVES AND QUITE APART FROM OUR OPINION WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TALK OF A WEARY ROAD A GIDDY HEIGHT A JOCUND MORNING OR A SULLEN SKY
911-128684-0038 AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
911-128684-0039 AND DOUBTLESS PASSES WITH MOST READERS FOR ALL RIGHT PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDYING OUR PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENT HAVE UNEARTHED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH MOVEMENT IS FELT IN GENERAL
911-128684-0040 BUT NOT ASCRIBED CORRECTLY TO THE BODY THAT REALLY MOVES THUS IN OPTICAL VERTIGO CAUSED BY UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENTS OF OUR EYES BOTH WE AND THE EXTERNAL UNIVERSE APPEAR TO BE IN A WHIRL
911-128684-0041 WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT BY THE MOON IT IS AS IF BOTH CLOUDS AND MOON AND WE OURSELVES SHARED IN THE MOTION IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF AMNESIA
911-128684-0042 PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
911-128684-0043 NOTICED AN ATTENDANT WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE IDENTIFIED THE MOVEMENT WITH THAT OF HIS OWN HE DID NOT YET DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS OWN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE HIMSELF
911-128684-0044 IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
911-128684-0045 MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
911-128684-0046 AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE LET THE READER ARREST HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF READING THIS ARTICLE NOW
911-128684-0047 IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
911-128684-0048 WE SHALL PROBABLY JUDGE IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH WITH THE AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ARE CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY PURE CONDITION LASTS IN PRACTICAL LIFE NO URGENT NEED HAS YET ARISEN FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT THEM AS RIGOROUSLY MENTAL
911-128684-0049 OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
911-128684-0050 ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
911-128684-0051 THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
911-128684-0052 THINGS ACT ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS ON US BY MEANS OF THEIR SECONDARY QUALITIES SOUND AS SUCH GOES THROUGH THE AIR AND CAN BE INTERCEPTED
911-128684-0053 INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
911-128684-0054 ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
911-128684-0055 NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF CALLING THESE QUALITIES SUBJECTIVE WHEN HOWEVER GALILEO DESCARTES AND OTHERS FOUND IT BEST FOR PHILOSOPHIC PURPOSES TO CLASS SOUND HEAT AND LIGHT ALONG WITH PAIN AND PLEASURE AS PURELY MENTAL PHENOMENA
911-128684-0056 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0057 ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
911-128684-0058 NATURE EXHIBITS ONLY CHANGES WHICH HABITUALLY COINCIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0059 BUT ONLY A TRANSLOCATION OF EXPERIENCES FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER A GROUPING OF THEM WITH ONE SET OR ANOTHER OF ASSOCIATES FOR DEFINITELY PRACTICAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENDS
911-128684-0060 I WILL SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE PERSISTENT AMBIGUITY OF RELATIONS THEY ARE UNDENIABLE PARTS OF PURE EXPERIENCE YET WHILE COMMON SENSE AND WHAT I CALL RADICAL EMPIRICISM STAND FOR THEIR BEING OBJECTIVE
911-128684-0061 BOTH RATIONALISM AND THE USUAL EMPIRICISM CLAIM THAT THEY ARE EXCLUSIVELY THE WORK OF THE MIND' THE FINITE MIND OR THE ABSOLUTE MIND AS THE CASE MAY BE
911-128684-0062 TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0063 IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
911-128684-0064 NOR DOES ITS USE OR SIGNIFICANCE
911-128684-0065 ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
911-128684-0066 EVEN SUCH THINGS AS FORCES TENSIONS AND ACTIVITIES CAN AT A PINCH BE REGARDED AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTIONS SO FAR THEN AS THE PHYSICAL WORLD MEANS THE COLLECTION OF CONTENTS THAT DETERMINE IN EACH OTHER CERTAIN REGULAR CHANGES
911-128684-0067 THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF OUR APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES HAS TO BE TREATED AS FALLING OUTSIDE OF IT IF WE MEAN BY PHYSICAL NATURE WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THE SURFACE OF OUR BODIES
911-128684-0068 WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
911-128684-0069 THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
911-128684-0070 THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
911-128684-0071 MEANS ALSO THAT IT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE BODILY EFFECTS UPON US ALTERATIONS OF TONE AND TENSION OF HEART BEAT AND BREATHING OF VASCULAR AND VISCERAL ACTION
911-128684-0072 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
911-128684-0073 THAT HOWEVER IS ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING CLASSED AS ABSOLUTELY NON OBJECTIVE THE ATTEMPT IF ANY ONE SHOULD MAKE IT TO SORT EXPERIENCES INTO TWO ABSOLUTELY DISCRETE GROUPS
911-128684-0074 WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0075 FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
911-128684-0076 THEY YET ACT ON EACH OTHER IN THE MOST ENERGETIC WAY BY THOSE VERY CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SO INERT EXTRACORPOREALLY IT IS BY THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THAT EXPERIENCES HAVE FOR US BY THE EMOTIONS THEY EXCITE
911-128684-0077 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0078 FITNESS FIXES THEIR ORDER AND CONNECTION I NEED ONLY REFER FOR THIS ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL LIFE
911-128684-0079 IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HOWEVER BE AN UNNATURAL STATUS IF THE POPULAR OPINION WHICH I CITED AT THE OUTSET WERE CORRECT IF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MEANT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTRINSIC NATURE
911-128684-0080 IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
911-128684-0081 BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
911-128684-0082 TAKE A MASS OF CARRION FOR EXAMPLE
911-128684-0083 THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
911-128684-0084 IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
911-128684-0085 AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
911-128684-0086 SOMETIMES AGAIN I THINK OF IT AS MINE I SORT IT WITH THE ME AND THEN CERTAIN LOCAL CHANGES AND DETERMINATIONS IN IT PASS FOR SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS ITS BREATHING IS MY THINKING
911-128684-0087 ITS SENSORIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE MY ATTENTION
911-128684-0088 ITS VISCERAL PERTURBATIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS THE OBSTINATE CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ARISEN OVER SUCH STATEMENTS AS THESE WHICH SOUND SO PARADOXICAL AND WHICH CAN YET BE MADE SO SERIOUSLY
911-128684-0089 PROVE HOW HARD IT IS TO DECIDE BY BARE INTROSPECTION WHAT IT IS IN EXPERIENCES THAT SHALL MAKE THEM EITHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL IT SURELY CAN BE NOTHING INTRINSIC IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0090 IT IS THEIR WAY OF BEHAVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEIR SYSTEM OF RELATIONS THEIR FUNCTION AND ALL THESE THINGS VARY WITH THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND IT OPPORTUNE TO CONSIDER THEM I THINK I MAY CONCLUDE THEN
911-128684-0091 AND I HOPE THAT MY READERS ARE NOW READY TO CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE PRETENDED SPIRITUALITY OF OUR EMOTIONS AND OF OUR ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE SO FAR FROM PROVING AN OBJECTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PURE EXPERIENCE DOES WHEN RIGHTLY DISCUSSED AND ACCOUNTED FOR
